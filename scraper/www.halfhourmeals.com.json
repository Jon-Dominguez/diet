Measure the flour and baking powder into a sieve and sift into a bowl, holding the sieve quite high to give the flour a good airing as it goes down.Now all you do is simply add all the other sponge ingredients to the bowl and, provided the butter is really soft, you just go in with an electric hand whisk and whisk everything together until you have a smooth, well-combined mixture. This will take 1 minute but, if you don't have an electric hand whisk, you can use a wooden spoon with a bit more effort. What you now end up with is a mixture that drops easily off a spoon when you give it a tap on the side of the bowl. If it does seem a little too stiff, add 1-2 tablespoons of tap water and mix again.Now divide the mixture between the two tins, level it out and place on the centre shelf of the oven. It will take 30-35 minutes to cook \u2013 don't open the oven door until 30 minutes have elapsed. To test if they are cooked or not, touch the centre lightly with your little finger; if it leaves no impression and springs back, the sponge is cooked.Next, remove them from the oven then wait for about 5 minutes before turning them out on to a wire cooling rack. Carefully peel off the base papers, leave the sponges to get completely cold, then add the filling.For the filling, combine the mascarpone and fromage frais in a bowl; a balloon whisk will amalgamate them quicker. Add the level tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Now spread one tablespoon of jam over one of the sponge cakes, follow this with half the cream mixture then scatter the raspberries all over that. Now add the remaining cream mixture and drizzle it with the rest of the jam. Place the second sponge cake on top.

Start by making mashed potato. This dish needs a more French-style mash (heavier, creamier, silkier) than an American-style mash (lighter, fluffier).  Take some waxy potatoes; peel and boil them in salted water until tender.  Water is the mortal enemy of mashed potato and will turn any mash into a stodgy gloop.  If you have asbestos hands, you can boil the potatoes with the skins on to reduce the amount of water that gets in but realistically, slipping the skins off a hot potato generally means sacrificing the tips of my wee fingers.  Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot they were cooked in.  The heat from the pot will drive off even more water and the edges of the potatoes will go a dry white colour.  Pass the potatoes through a mouli or ricer or just mash them (I prefer the ricer).  Then add in some cream, salt, pepper and butter and beat it all together with a wooden spoon until it is really creamy and smooth. To the cooked mash add about a quarter teaspoon of prepared wasabi per very heaped tablespoon of mash (or an equivalent portion of fresh grated wasabi). Don't add too much because you don't want it to be too pungent.  Keep this warm and covered and beat in some more cream if it dries out\n\r\n2.  Roll up the aojiso leaves and julienne (you need lots, but leave a few for serving).  \n\r\n3. Dust the scallops with seasoned flour and sear in a hot pan with some butter and olive oil.\n\r\n4.  Set another small pan over medium-high heat and add quite a lot of butter.  When foaming, add the shredded aojiso. The butter should brown ever so slightly, but you are not really trying to make a brown butter sauce.  Once the shiso crisps (but before it browns) remove from the heat and separate out the shiso from the butter.  To the butter, add a dash of soy and a squeeze of lemon juice.  Season if necessary.  Separating out the shiso before adding the soy lets the shiso retain its light green colour.  Otherwise, the soy will dye it a dark green.  \n\r\n5.  For presentation, lay a fresh shiso leaf on a plate or shallow dish and place a quenelle of wasabi mash on top of it.  Add the scallops, top with the crispy shiso and spoon over the butter sauce.\n\r\nThere's nothing particularly novel about wasabi mash, but it works well with this. I like this dish because the crispy shiso really adds something here. It keeps its minty, peppery flavour and the crispness really contrasts against the creamy mash, tender scallops and nutty butter."}
{"cook_time": "15 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "This is a really easy recipe as long as you can get your grubby mitts on a packet of laksa paste, which is available at all local supermarkets (if you\u2019re overseas, it should be available in Asian supermarkets).

Important note: the consistency of the broth should be slightly gravy-like but still watery. If it\u2019s too milky, the risotto will become too rich and gooey (unless you want it really mushy!). Add salt to taste.\n\r\n3. In a large skillet or wok, fry the risotto with a good glug of olive oil until the grains start turning translucent. Then pour a third of the broth into wok, stir well, and bring to a boil. Stir again, bring down the heat to a simmer, and cover.\n\r\n4. Here comes the slightly troublesome part: keep stirring every two or three minutes to make sure the risotto doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom. When the liquid level seems to go down, add broth by the ladlefuls until the risotto is submerged. Keep doing this until the risotto is about half cooked (soft but still has a hard bite to it). Depending on how strong your fire is, this should take between 10 to 15 minutes.\n\r\n5. Toss in your prawns, beansprouts and fishcake, and stir well. Add broth if the liquid level goes down. Continue cooking until the risotto achieves that nice slightly creamy texture and has a soft but not too mushy texture, and the ingredients are cooked through.\n\r\n6. Turn off the fire, add the spinach and stir well - the greens should wilt in a matter of minutes in the remaining heat. Serve in nice big bowls, and enjoy!"}

If using duck breasts, which I assume you guys will be doing 'cos you'll be getting rid of the rest of your ducks from making all that confit, place them skin side down in a dry pan, and cook over high heat for about 5 minutes to render some of the fat out.

Discard the water used for soaking. Also, it's more authentic to use duck with bones in for the soup, but this is a good way to get rid of the extra breasts after you try my confit recipe. :)"}

If you have an electric whisk, you can just sieve the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl, then add the rest of the ingredients for the orange sponge. Whisk it all together until you have a well combined and smooth mixture. \n\r\n2. If you don't have an electric whisk, like me, you will just have to resort to the traditional method of cake making! First combine the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl, using a wooden spoon, until you get a light yellow, smooth mixture. Seive the flour and baking powder into the same mixing bowl (hold the sieve up high, so you get lots of air into the mixture), then add your whisked eggs bit by bit. Blend it all together using a dessert spoon, drawing a figure of 8 in the cake batter, folding the mixture together. \n\r\n3. Next caramelize the pears by melting the butter in a pan and the light brown sugar, then add the pear slices and cook for about couple of minutes on each side. \n\r\n4. Grease your cake tins and line with baking parchment. Remember to grease the inside of the baking parchment too. \n\r\n5. Place the pears in a layer on the bottom, then sprinkle a thin layer of almonds before pouring in the cake mixture. \n\r\n6. Bake in the oven till golden brown. To test if the cake is done, you can push your finger gently in the centre and if the sponge springs back leaving no impressions, it's ready. Make sure to not open the oven door too soon, as you may deflate the cake while it's still rising. \n\r\n7.

Prep the dough (typically the day beforehand): mix the dry ingredients (except for the powdered sugar) in a big metal bowl, then add the wet ingredients, including the yeast and butter.  (Addition of wheat gluten will make the fritters more airy but a little tougher -- it's your choice to do this or not)  Mix to combine into a dough, cover with a clean towel, and either rise for an hour at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge.\n\r\nWhen you are ready to eat the fritters, get out the flour and sprinkle it over the surface (use a cutting board or a big piece of wax paper, don't use your countertop), wet your hands, and coat them with flour too.  Gather up the dough in the bowl and put it on the floured surface you just prepared. \n\r\nKnead the dough a couple times (not too much or you will make it too tough), then roll it out about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick.  If you do not own a rolling pin, a wine bottle dusted in flour is fine.  Cut some squares 2-3 inches a side (or triangles 3+ inches a side) and set to rest (final rising stage).\n\r\nMeanwhile, heat a quart or more of oil to 365-375 degrees (a candy thermometer is cheap and useful for this purpose).  The more oil you use, the less it will cool off when you add each fritter, but the more it will cost.  I use a 1.5qt pot and fry them one at a time.    If you own a fryer, set it for 375 degrees.  Get a cooling rack (or steal one from your toaster oven, bbq grill, or screen door) and put paper towels underneath it for draining.\n\r\nAfter about 10 minutes, the oil should be up to temperature and the pieces of dough should have risen noticeably.  Use a slotted spoon to put each one into the frying oil -- if you are using a small pot, you'll fry them one at a time.  After about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or once the fritter has puffed up and turned golden brown, flip it over and fry the other side (another 1 to 2 minutes).  Remove with the slotted spoon and drain on the cooling rack, so that any excess oil drips onto the paper towels underneath.\n\r\nSprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve immediately.  Traditionally served with hot cafe au lait (scalded milk + pot-extracted coffee and chicory), the fritters are also tasty with berry preserves or syrup."}

Thanks mum :)\n\r\nCook your spaghetti in boiling salted water, throw into the pasta sauce pot/pan straight away.\n\r\nPut the lid on the pan for about 15mins off the heat, and wait for the sauce to absorb into the pasta.\r\nThis step is critical as it will allow the dish to become slightly dry (which is how I like bolognese).  I guess for those who like to have a saucy meal, just serve and eat straight away.  Don't reduce so much."}

Soak your beans - Take some black-eye beans, the amount will depend on how much you want to make. Cover in cold water and soak overnight. The next day, take some time out and use your fingers to rub and remove all the skins. The skin won't make it inedible or anything... however, it will look more attractive without the skin. \n\r\n2. Boil Your Beans - Take your beans and cover in water, and simmer until soft. \n\r\n3. Mash your beans - Once soft, you can drain the water, and mash up the beans. This can be done using a potato masher, blender or some other mashing utensil. My gran uses a chinese soup spoon.\n\r\n4. Fry the beans and make the filling - Dry-fry the mashed beans in a non-stick pan. Make sure that the pan is bone dry and no oil is used. This is to dehydrate the beans so that you're not left with a mushy wet slop that would be difficult to handle and not taste so good. After about 10 minutes or so, you and add other filling ingredients to enhance the flavour and continue frying with added oil. \n\r\n5. Make your dough - This recipe calls for glutinous rice flour. We used the whole packet, but kept a little to the side to keep the fingers dry and non-sticky when it comes to making the separate doughy balls. So, for the moment, put around 4/5 of the packet into a big bowl. Gradually add hot (not boiling) water to the flour, mixing and kneading as you go until the flour becomes a soft doughy mixture. Not too dry, not too wet. Sorry, no measurements here. \n\r\n6. Making the ?? - filling your pastry with the filling. Cover your hands in flour, tear out a walnut sized piece of dough. Knead and roll in your hands until the dough becomes a smooth ball shape. Dip the ball in the flour to give a light coating of flour. Push a finder into the dough, making a hole, take a pinch of flour and place inside the hole. Stick the thumb of your right hand inside the hole. Using the other fingers, turn and squeeze the dough, stretching it up and out. Your left hand should be used for support. You should end up with a fairly large cup, ensure that you fix any holes. This is the point where you find out whether you got your dough consistency correct. Too little water and the dough won't be pliable, too much water and it will be sloppy and sticky, and you'll have holes all over the place. Fill the cup with your filling about 1 tablespoon full.  Take the mouth of the cup and turn whilst you squeeze and pleat, making the mouth smaller and smaller until you can twist the edges together. Tear off the little nub that's left at the end. Pat and Smooth the dough all over \n\r\n7. Soak your Bamboo Leaves - Bamboo leaves are used as the lining for your caa4 gwo2 to sit on. Once steamed, the dough becomes incredibly sticky and gooey. Without the bamboo leaves, you simply wouldn't be able to remove the ?? from the plate. These can be soaked whilst you were making your ??... so this should probably be step No 6. \n\r\n8. Cut your bamboo leaves into squares\r\nMake sure they're large enough to fit your ?? with a bit of extra space for the ?? to spread. \n\r\n9. Plop your ?? on top of the leaves \n\r\n10. Steam your ?? - Place the ?? on a plate or a wire rack and place inside a steamer. We used a wok full of boiling water with a high domed lid. In the water, we have a metal stand so that the dish with the caa gwo are high above the water. They don't need to be steamed for long, about 10 minutes should do. Gran says that you shouldn't overcook them or they become sloppy, likewise, you shouldn't undercook them or they're not pliable and squishy enough. \n\r\n11. Grease up your ?? - Once your ?? are done, take them out of the steamer, and start spreading cold vegetable/sunflower oil over the surface of the caa gwo. This is to give them a lovely sheen, and to stop them from sticking to eachother. \n\r\n12. Eat your lovely ?? - Best eaten practically straight out of the steamer. Be careful not to burn yourself. It's wonderful when warm, squishy and pliable. Once cooled, it hardens and becomes horrible and chewy. If you have to keep them for a day or so, wrap them up in plastic to prevent dehydration. Upon eating, they can be revitalised by sprinkling some water on them and microwaving for a bit."}

For this recipe, Mr. Henry chose The Macallan.\n\r\nSeparate six eggs. Whip the whites until stiff. Cream the yokes together with a cup (or more) of confectioners\u2019 sugar, beating until the color becomes pale. You raw-egg worry-worts at home, please relax. The sugar preserves the egg. In the fridge the concoction will stay perfectly fresh far longer than it will survive repeated servings to you and yours.\n\r\nFinally to the creamed yokes whip in a splash of scotch, dark rum, or any other spirit appropriate for a coffee, chocolate, and mascarpone confection. This last touch brings a perfume to the dish that separates it from a quotidian custard.\n\r\nWith big gestures and a big rubber spatula, lightly fold in the mascarpone and then the egg whites. Ecco! Mascarpone custard cream. Now you build.\n\r\nSlice the ladyfingers in half lengthwise if you like. (This is a decision more of style than of taste.) Spread half of them loosely in a deep dish pan.

When the noodles are soft and look done, remove from stove, and take the pot to your sink. Run the noodles over cold tap water until it is cold. Obviously don't let it fall out of the pot! You can use a colander if it helps. The idea is to get the noodles cold. Use ice if desperate. Then leave the noodles to drain.\r\n3. While waiting for the noodles to boil you should have chopped up the celery stalks.\r\n4. Toast the sesame seeds by dry frying them on a frying pan (no oil, no water), until one or two start to pop. It is quite important to use toasted sesame seed, as they are so much more delicious! You can toast them in a huge batch and keep in an air-tight container for future use.\r\n5. Now for the dressing, mix vinegar, sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil up in an air-tight container, cover up and then shake it like cocktail till all the sugar dissolves.\r\n6. Put your noodles in a big salad bowl, drain the wakame and add it to the bowl, add the celery as well. Pour dressing over it, mix well, now you can sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds. \n\r\nThis should make 2 servings.\n\r\nThe ingredients might look daunting at first, but they are rather useful basic Japanese ingredients which you could use to make many other dishes or use them in fusion with your regular cooking.\n\r\nAlso all of the ingredients in this recipe except for the celery, are ingredients you can keep in your cupboard for a long time, which makes this recipe great for times when you are caught without anything in your fridge.

Pre-heat your oven to 400. Trim the greens of the beets, slicing off the bottom as well. Do no peel the beets, simply quarter them and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and salt, cook for about 20 minutes in the 400 degree oven, until slightly tender.\n\r\n2. While the beets are cooking, mince the onion, and start heating the chicken broth in one of the saucepans. Once the broth has come to a simmer, the temp can be turned down.\n\r\n3. Once beets are done cooking, let them cool until they are ready to be handled. Now that the skins are loose, they are much easier to peel. A paring knife will do the job. After peeled, slice the beets into small chunks, no bigger than 1/4\".\n\r\n4. Heat the second sauce pan with enough olive oil to coat the bottom, and saut\u00e9 onions until they are translucent and soft, just a couple of minutes.\n\r\n5. Add the rice to the onions, stirring the rice so it is coated with the oil and onions.\n\r\n6. Add about a 1/2 cup of red wine (I never measure this). Stir until absorbed.\n\r\n7. Now we start adding the chicken broth. It goes in one ladle at a time, adding only after the liquid has been absorbed. A good way to know if it's ready for more liquid is that you can see the bottom of the pan when you stir while scrapping the bottom.\n\r\n8. I'm making this a separate step because it is very important. You may not use all the broth. Actually, you will most likely not use it all. The broth is added until the rice is done, and the only way you can do this is by taste. This also lets you monitor the salt content in the final few ladles. If you think the broth has made it too salty, add a ladle's worth of warm water. \n\r\n9. Start tasting when the rice has plumped and starts to look ready. It is not rice pudding, there needs to be a bit of texture to the rice. It's a bit like cooking pasta al dente.\n\r\n10. Once the rice is done, this generally takes a good half hour, take it off the heat and add the 2 Tbsp of butter and 1/2 of Parmesan cheese. \n\r\nServe with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese."}

Cut the stalk of the artichoke about 5cm from the base of the heart and slice across the top of the artichoke. Smear the freshly cut 'face' with the cut lemon. Artichokes oxidise and brown as soon as you start cutting into it. \n\r\n2. Using a small knife, start peeling off the outer tough leaves one by one and keep going till you get to the tender light green leaves. \n\r\n3. To remove the choke ( the purple furry flower in the middle ), insert a teaspoon into the centre of the flower and carefully twist the spoon. Be careful not to break the tender leaves on the side. Again, smear with lemon. \n\r\n4. Use the small knife to carefully clean off the broken leave bases from the bottom of the heart and remove the tough stringy skin from the stalk. \n\r\n5. Slice the artichoke into halves or quarters and drop into the bowl of lemon water, and onto your next artichoke till you prepared them all.\n\r\n6. Fill a large saucepan with couple of inches of  water and add a good amount of white wine vinegar, bring to the boil. Add the artichokes and simmer for 15-18min till tender. \n\r\n7. While the artichokes are cooking you can prepare the tomatoes and put them into a large bowl. Season and dress with a glug of extra virgin olive oil and some lemon juice. \n\r\n8. In a bowl, put few glugs of olive oil and some garlic puree. When the artichokes are done, toss them in the oil and season generously with salt and pepper. \n\r\n9. Heat a griddle pan over a medium to low heat and griddle the artichokes until golden and slightly charred at the edges. \n\r\n10.

Happy Birthday Jo....\n\nThin Sponge Cake Layer For Cheesecake\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0C and butter a spring form and dredge it with flour.\n2. Mix flour, corn starch, baking powder and salt in a bowl.\n3. Stir the yolk with a mixer 3 minutes. Add during mixing the sugar (70g) and and go on with stiring for about 5 minutes. Add vanille sugar and lemon peel.\n4. Sift the flour-mix and mix it till you can't see any white flour-spots. Add the butter and stir it again.\n5. Whisk the egg white stiff with a dash salt in a clean bowl. Then add the sugar (25g - 2 tablespoons) slowly. Go on with stiring. Take ca. 1/3 of the eggwhite and mix it with the flour-mix. Then fold in the the 2/3 of the egg white. Attention --- don't overact... it doesn't matter if you can see some egg-white-spots!\n6. Give the dough carefully to the spring form. Bake it just as long, that if you touch the middle of the cake you can feel that the dough \"jumps\" bake to the form. In all NOT longer than 10 minutes! Let it cool down in your kitchen and make the filling. Don't take it out of the spring form. Wrap the spring form with 2 slices of tin foil and caulking it.\n\nThe Cream Cheese Filling\n\n1. Give 1/4 of the cream cheese, 1/3 of sugar and the corn starch in a bowl. Stir with a electronic mixer for 3 minutes. Then add the rest of the cream cheese.\n2. Add the sugar and vanille sugar and mix it on the highest level. Add the eggs - one at time. Then the cream. Mix it just for a short time!!! Don't overact - just till the cream is stirred.\n3. Give the cheese creme-mix carefully to the spring form. (Take the foil away). Put the spring form in a bigger form and fill this one with 3 cm of hot water. Bake it for 60 min. (Till the cake wiggle barely.)\n4. (Cool down for 60minutes) - Cover in polythene foil and let it cool for 4 hours or overnight. \n5. 4 hours later or on the next morning you can take the cake out of the spring form.\n\nCherry Topping\n\nIf you want you can make a delicious topping! In this case we decided to make just a \"round frame\" .. so we had the possibility to write something in the middle of the cake!\n\nGive all to a pan and cook it. Cook it for 1-2 minutes till the sauce is thicker. Cool it down for a minute and decorate the cake with this!"}

Recently while browsing through my usual design magazines, I came across this sexy new [Pasta Pan for Alessi](http://www.designws.com/pagina/1alessi2.html). The design of the pasta pan came from this traditional(?!) Italian method of cooking pasta, which is to cook it the same way as you would cook risotto. Seems so simple and logical that I just had to try it that night, to see what it tasted like compare to the usual method of preparing pasta. So here is how I did it, with ingredients I had in my cupboard.**", "title": "Pasta Dish - Risotto Style", "ingredients": ["Dry pasta", "Vegetable stock / hot", "Lump of butter", "Onion / finely chopped", "Garlic / finely chopped", "Aubergine / chopped", "Red pepper / chopped", "Cherry tomato / Sliced", "Sun-dried tomato pesto", "Basil", "Parmesan cheese / grated", "Salt n' Pepper"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/pasta-dish--risotto-style", "prep_time": "15 Min", "method": "1. Melt the butter in a sexy looking saucepan and soften the onion and garlic on low heat. \n\r\n2. Add dry pasta and stir through, so the pasta is coated in the butter. \n\r\n3. Add some of the boiling vegetable stock and stir through. Add the stock little bit at a time and stir the pasta till its par cooked. \n\r\n4. Add the red peppers, aubergine and little bit more stock. Continue cooking and stirring and add little stock at a time.  \n\r\n5. Just before the pasta is cooked to your preferred texture, add the tomato, pesto and torn basil leaves, stir through, season to taste and cover for a minute. \n\r\n6. Serve with few small basil leaves sprinkled on top and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. \n\r\n**Optional extras**\n\r\nThe possibilities are endless. Pull out all your risotto recipes and try them with some pasta instead! \n\r\n**In conclusion, I find the pasta to be more flavourful and the whole dish blends nicely into one just like a risotto dish. I am not a fan of creamy white pasta sauce, so with this method you get the creamy texture but with a tomato base. I also like the way you can really control the texture of the pasta. It is, however, more of a 'winter' dish. TRY IT TODAY!**"}

This is just the way I learned, and the way I like it best, but it's very versatile and fun to play with additions. Ol\u00e9!", "title": "Tortilla de Dspa\u00f1a de Deliciousa", "ingredients": ["6 potatoes, peeled and rinsed", "4-5 large eggs", "1 large white onion", "about 1 cup extra virgin olive oil (some people have slight heart attacks when they see the amount of oil required, but big oily is key", "salt", "pepper"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/tortilla-de-espaa-de-deliciousa", "prep_time": "15 Min", "method": "1. Cut the potatoes laterally, then into half-moon slices, each about half an inch thick\n\r\n2. pour the gadzillion gallons of oil into a 9-inch-ish frying pan, and turn heat on high a few minutes, till the oil is very hot, but not smoking.\n\r\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan (do this very carefully, because the oil is at a prime disfiguring-skin-burn heat level). Stir it up a bit, so the oil has coated all the potatoes and they are spread out to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally to keep them from burning, then add the onions. Mix onions in with the potatoes, again stirring sporadically to ward off Mr. Burny, but not too much.\n\r\n4. When the potatoes are golden and a little squishy (about ten more minutes), take pan off the heat. Use a slotted spoon to move the mix into a large bowl, and pour the leftover oil into a separate container (you'll need it again) and wipe down the pan.\n\r\n5. While the potato/onions cool a bit, start on the eggs. For a fluffy texture, I like to separate the yolk and white. Use a fork and viciously stir the whites till they're nice and frothy (about the consistency of a rabid dog's mouth foam, but not quite as thick as a rabid raccoon's). \n\r\n6. After letting the po-nion mix cool about five minutes, toss in the yolks. DON'T OVERMIX IT, just give it a few swipes to coat around, then add the whites and do the same. Give it ten minutes to absorb the eggs. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\r\n7. put about a tablespoon or two of the saved oil in the pan. Heat it up about a minute (again, simmery, not smokey), then pour in the egg-tater-onion mix, spreading it to cover the pan bottom. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook about ten minutes. Don't stir, but do shake the pan every once in a while, to make sure it doesn't stick. the surface shouldn't cook through, but it should get a bit less runny.\n\r\n8. This part is kind of tricky, but don't be scared. Take a big plate or the lid of the frying pan and place it over the mix. Grab the pan handle, and turn the whole thing upside down so the uncooked portion of the tortilla will be face down on the plate. This is best done whilst over the sink or a bowl to catch drippings and/or crashings down in failure. \n\r\n9. Now the soon-to-be-perfect-tortilla is cooked-side facing up! Magic! add another spoon or two of oil to the pan, then slide the uncooked-tortilla-side on down. This will only need to cook about two minutes. I like it kind of runny inside; if you want the mixture firmer, cook it longer, and stick a toothpick into the center to gauge done-ness. You can also flip it a few more times, to your heart\u2019s desire. Use a spatula to kind of mold the edges if you want them pretty.\n\r\n10. Eat. Love. I think it's tastiest about room temp, usually with some salt, and maybe tomato and mozzarella salad. Makes an excellent hangover food."}

{"cook_time": "15 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "This recipe is an answer to the eternal question of what to do with that can of sweetened chestnut puree you got at the gourmet shop four years ago.\r\n\r\nI went hunting among various websites one day looking for a quick answer to this problem, and found a lot of recipes involving (a) a great deal of work and (b) entirely too much chocolate and/or sugar. Most of these recipes seemed bent on using the chestnut puree merely as a sweetening agent or as a way to make a chocolate cake moister.  This seemed somehow unfair, as the chestnut's delicate flavor can stand quite nicely on its own.\r\n\r\nSome more searching turned up an extremely uncomplicated treatment native to the Ard\u00e9che region, where chestnuts are widely grown and used for their flour as well as for confectionery purposes. The recipe on the French website was very short on instructions (assuming, maybe correctly, that a lot of people reading it would be bakers skilled enough to know how best to treat the ingredients). Nonetheless, the recipe as I adapted it produces a tart that's definitely worth making -- quick, crustless, and more like a rich, faintly sweet chestnut cloud than anything else.", "title": "Tarte de Puree des Chataignes / Chestnut Puree Tart", "ingredients": ["1 500g / 1-pound can sweetened chestnut puree", "80g / 3 ounces butter", "5 eggs, separated", "Baking chocolate to garnish", "Also required: large deep 9-inch pie pan, or similar baking tin"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/tarte-de-puree-des-chataignes-chestnut-puree-tart", "prep_time": "15 Min", "method": "1. Preheat the oven to 180C / 350F. Liberally butter the pie pan or tin.\r\n2. Melt the 80g / 3 ounces of butter in the microwave or on the stove. Set aside to cool slightly.\r\n3. Separate the eggs. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks together with the chestnut puree until the mixture becomes light and thick (the goal is to beat as much air into the mixture as possible. Then, a little at a time, beat in the melted butter. Set aside.\r\n4. Beat the egg whites to the stiff-peak stage. Then add them to the egg yolk-chestnut puree mixture by spoonfuls and use a spatula to fold the whites carefully in. Don't panic if there are occasional small bits of stiff egg white left unfolded-in: it won't hurt the final result.\r\n5. When the oven is ready, pour the batter into the tin and place gently in the oven. Don't bang the oven door, as the mixture at this point is more like a souffle than anything else. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes. Keep an eye on the browning of the top of the tart: you don't want it too dark. If this starts happening, carefully open and close the oven door to let some heat out: then lower the oven heat slightly and bake for a few minutes longer.\r\n6. The tart will puff up considerable while baking. Once removed from the oven, it will start to collapse. Don't panic, as this is normal. While still hot, use a very fine grater (a lemon-zest-size grater works well) to grate bitter baking chocolate over the whole top of the tart. It will melt onto the tart's top. You may want to do several layers of this.\r\n7. Allow the tart to cool. (If you like, you might want to drizzle melted chocolate over it.) Slice and serve with thick cream, whipped cream, or pouring custard. Or (as my husband did in the picture he took) you may like to just grate a little more chocolate onto the side and dip each forkful into it.\n\r\n(BTW, this recipe also lives, with many friends, at our food website:)\n\r\nhttp://www.europeancuisines.com"}

Cut the roast beef slices into half, lengthwise, and wash and dry all the sprigs of watercress.\r\n4. To assemble, place a sprig of watercress on the baguette slice, then top with a dollop of the cream mixture, then roll up the slice of baguette and sit it in the dollop of cream. Try not to use too much cream (about 1 heaped tsp per slice should do) as the taste will end up overpowering the beef and the watercress.\r\n5.

Dump this out through a strainer discarding the water, rinse the pot then thoroughly clean each piece of oxtail.\n\r\nAdd the cleaned ox tail and 10 cups of fresh water into the pot along with the star anise, peppercorns, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, cilantro stems/roots, and onion. Bring it to a boil then lower the heat to low, cover and simmer for 3-4 hours (the longer you go, the more depth your soup will have).\n\r\nWhile you\u2019re waiting you can make some garlic chips by mandolining a few garlic cloves then adding them to a few tablespoons of hot oil over medium heat. Stir to ensure even browning then remove to a paper towel lined plate when they reach a nice golden brown.\n\r\nWhen it\u2019s done, pass the soup through a strainer into another pot skimming off any excess oil. Season with the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar and salt. I tend to go light on the salt as some of the condiments I add have some salt in them, but if you\u2019re not planning on adding anything later, feel free to give it a bit more salt. Pick the meat off the bones and set aside.\n\r\nTo serve, boil a large pot of water, add the rehydrated rice noodles, stirring until the water comes to a boil again (about 1 minute). Meanwhile, reheat the beef balls in the soup. When the noodles are done, strain them through colander and add to the bowls. Top the noodles with some of the ox tail meat, onions, garlic chips, a bit of the garlic oil and Meicai. Laddle the hot soup and beef balls over the noodles then serve with the rest of the condiments. I also like having a little bowl of Sriracha and hoisin sauce to dip the meat in."}

Place the eggs, caster sugar, and salt in the bowl of your standing mixer and stir briefly.\r\n2. Bring 1-2cm of water to a simmer in a saucepan, and place the mixer's bowl over it. Ensure that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water.\r\n3. Whisk the egg mixture (it would be prudent to use an electric one, unless you're feeling guilty about skipping this week's gym sessions) until the temperature registers 70\u00b0C on the thermometer.\r\n4. Replace the bowl in the standing mixer, and mix on medium-high speed (I used Speed 6 on my KitchenAid) for 5 minutes, or until cooled to room temperature.\r\n5. Reduce the speed to medium (Speed 4 on my KitchenAid), and - with the motor running - add in the butter one cube at a time. It will look curdled and weird about halfway through, but don't worry cos it'll smoothen out again into a luscious mess by the end of it.\r\n6. Add in the espresso, mix until fully combined (you might want to scrape the sides down), then turn the speed up to high (Speed 8 or 10 on my KitchenAid) and whip for 1 minute.\n\r\nIt's now ready to be piped/spread on your cupcakes, and can be stored, refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 5 days. If it's hard to pipe just out of the fridge, either zap it in the microwave for 10 seconds, or re-whip it in the mixer for 30 seconds and that should do the trick.\n\r\nNote: To make vanilla buttercream, just omit the espresso, and add in 2 tsp vanilla extract to the egg mixture in Step 1.\n\r\n##Chocolate Coated Coffee Beans\r\n1. Cut the chocolate up into small bits with a serated knife, and place it in a bain-marie. Stir once or twice until fully melted, then give it a good stir with a rubber spatula.\r\n2. Drop your coffee beans in, and give it a good stir to make sure each one is well coated.\r\n3. Pick the beans out of the chocolate, and let the excess chocolate drip off. I like using chopsticks to do this. Place them on a sheet of greaseproof paper to cool, and place them all in the fridge for about 30minutes or until set. Once its set, you can transfer them to a box (lined with grease proof paper), and keep tightly sealed in the fridge for quite long. No idea how long they last though - I always finish eating them within a couple of days. :)\n\r\nNote: If you're a neat freak, just use your fingers to mould the bottom of the beans so they're perfectly round. The heat from your fingers should make the chocolate pliable enough. After that, you can pop them back onto the greaseproof paper in the fridge and they'll solidify in a snap."}

Remove the skin from the belly pork and separate the fat from the meat.  Cut the fat into lardons and chop the meat.  Marinade the chopped meat in a little chopped garlic, some white pepper, cornstarch, Maggi seasoning and sesame oil.  Render the lardons of fat over extremely low heat in a small frypan.  This will take about an hour and at the end of the process the liquid fat will be separated and you will be left with small crispy nuggets of pork fat (chu yau cha).  Pour of the fat and you're ready for frying.  (Of course, if you can buy solid pork fat separately you could use that for the chu yau cha and use another cut of pork for the meat in the dish.  I use belly pork simply because I can't buy the meat and fat separately.)\n\r\n2.  If you started with around 200 grams of pork belly (including fat and skin), that's enough for about two people.  While the fat is rendering, peel your prawns (around 3 or 4 each), cut the squid into rectangles and chop a bowl full of chinese cabbage crossways at around 1cm intervals.  Finely chop around 3 cloves of garlic.  Separate and soak your noodles in a large bowl full of cold water.  Your prep is done.  Tidy up and get your wok out, ready to fry.\n\r\n3.  Heat the reserved pork fat (the liquid, not the chu yau cha) in the wok until hot and add in the pork meat to brown.  When just browned throw in the prawns, squid and garlic.  After 30 seconds or so add in the Chinese cabbage and toss for another 30 seconds.  \n\r\n4.  Add in enough noodles for two people and pour over about half a cup of chicken stock.  Then add your seasonings: about a tablespoon of light soy sauce, a few healthy shakes of white pepper, about one and a half tablespoons of dark soy sauce (or more - the colour of the dish should be very dark) and a heaped teaspoon of sugar.  Toss in the wok and cook for a minute or two until the noodles are done.\n\r\n5.  To serve, make sure you get plenty of the thick, black gravy that has collected in the bottom of the wok in each serve.  The picture above doesn't quite do it justice, but trust me - there was a delicious thick black gravy around it.  Although it is a fried noodle dish, the gravy is very important.  Scatter the dish with crispy pork fat and serve with a spoonful of the sambal belcan and a wedge of lemon if you like.\n\r\n6.  Don't get any on your shirt."}

However, you can also do variations on this and add herbs to the frittata - in which case add 2 tbsp of finely chopped herbs (e.g. dill, tarragon, chives would do nicely), and you can obviously use cracked black pepper here.\r\n- The cream cheese mixture, salmon rosettes, chopped onions, and chives can be prepared and set aside in the fridge in advance. (Cover the onions with clingfilm so you don't stink up the whole fridge.) Just store it all in the fridge. The frittatas can be done a couple of hours ahead of time, just store at room temperature, and pop back into the oven set at 120\u00b0C on a baking tray to warm through for 1-2 minutes. The final assembly just takes a few minutes, and can be done just before your guests arrive."}

Of course, the age-old problem of living in Japan reared it\u2019s ugly head and I wasn\u2019t able to find lamb belly here.  I actually think it worked out better with lamb ribs and without the rice.

Rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\r\nWhile the lamb is cooking you can make the salsa verde. Don't make this too far in advance - you need to serve the salsa verde within about half and hour of making it as the vinegar will \"cook\" the green out of the herbs and it won't look nice.  Just throw all the solid ingredients into a food processor in the proportions you like - I used a whole coriander plant (with root), a big handful of mint, 5 or 6 shiso leaves, 5 green chillies and two cloves of garlic.  Pulse it for a few seconds until finely chopped and then transfer out to a bowl.  I added about a teaspoon of fish sauce, a teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of yuzu kosho, about one and a half tablespoons of rice vinegar and a big squeeze of lemon juice.  Mix it all together and that\u2019s it.\n\r\nChop the ribs, dress with the sauce (or serve it separately) and enjoy.  I served this with rice separately and with more of the sauce on the side.\n\r\nA big difference between the sauce and a normal salsa verde (apart from ALL the ingredients, of course) is that it contains no oil.  The flavour is sweet and biting and is perfect for cutting through rich foods like roasted meats or fried fish.  I eat a variation of this (no mint) with Siew Yuk and it is perfect. \n\r\nI also like this sauce with roasted lamb flaps.  If you don\u2019t know about lamb flaps, they are the belly off-cuts from the end of the chop.  They\u2019re sinfully cheap and pornographically fatty.  A favourite in Fijian cooking, the import of lamb flaps has actually been banned in Fiji now in an effort to curb rampant obesity.  When a country bans importing a food for making everybody too fat you know you\u2019re in trouble.  But still, do yourself a favour.  Just once a year - no more - pick up some lamb flaps (around A$1 a kilo in Australia; never seen them in Japan) and slow roast them for a couple of hours in a low oven to render off most of the fat.  Make up a simple sauce of coriander, chili, vinegar and sugar, sit back, watch some football and enjoy one of the simplest, cheapest and yet most obscenely indulgent things you could ever eat.\n\r\nBut back to the recipe - yeah, try this out too.

{"cook_time": "10 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "There's something just that much more luxurious about freshly home-made pasta, and for some reason most of the fresh pasta recipes I've found and tried all make ginormous amounts of pasta. I finally found one that I could tweak for two people with good appetites to have for a simple dinner at home (or you could probably feed 3 or 4 as part of a 4-or-more course dinner). This is just a simple recipe for plain egg pasta. It works well for noodley pasta like tagliatelle (which I tried to make here, but ended up with something between tagliatelle and parpadelle), as well as ravioli. I think most people don't realise how dead simple it is to make your own pasta. Definitely try this one, and you'll be hooked - I promise!\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, plenty of other ways to make pasta: including using different types of flour such as semolina, or different types of liquid like water, egg yolks only, or a mixture of the three. Then there's adding things like spinach, squid ink, herbs and the suchlike for flavourings and colouring. Start off with something simple like this, then you can start experimenting to see which type you like most.\r\n\r\nNote: for ravioli, the sheets of pasta should be almost translucent, I've rolled these sheets a fair bit thicker than that.", "title": "Fresh Egg Pasta", "ingredients": ["150g italian type '00' flour, sifted (or an all-purpose flour with about 10% protein content, double sifted", "2 whole eggs, beaten", "a pinch of salt", "extra flour for dusting"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/fresh-egg-pasta", "prep_time": "30 Min", "method": "1.

Starting from the centre, and using a fork (or your fingers if you wish), mix it in a circular motion, incorporating a bit more of the flour at a time as you go along, until the mixture is no longer squishy, then you can chuck the fork in the sink, roll up your sleeves, and knead it around a bit until it gets a bit of an elastic feel and a nice sheen.\n\r\n4. Wrap it tightly in clingwrap and set it aside for at least 15 minutes (preferably 30 or more) to rest. This will help to make it a lot more manageable when you're rolling it out. If you're going to be rolling by hand, you might want to let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour to an hour and a half.\n\r\n5. Divide the dough into two, and roll it into 2 rough balls, then flatten one into a rectangular piece and keep the other under a damp tea towel. Run it through the widest setting of your pasta roller twice, then fold it over and run it through again. Repeat this 2 or 3 times.\n\r\n6. Crank the setting down and slowly get it to the thinness you require, then you're ready to cut it up and/or fill it, and cook it!\n\r\nKeep in mind that fresh pasta takes a lot less time to cook than dried pasta.

Preheat your oven to 110\u00b0C. Place the ramekins in a roasting pan lined with a dishcloth.\r\n2. Place the cream in a heavy-based saucepan with the vanilla pod (and all the seeds), and heat gently until just before it comes to the boil. Remove from heat, and set aside for 10 minutes to allow vanilla flavour to infuse.\r\n3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks together with the sugar until mixture is pale and frothy.\r\n4. Strain about half a cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks, and whisk thoroughly. Strain in the remainder in 3 batches, whisking thoroughly in between to ensure that the egg doesn't get overheated and curdle.\r\n5. Divide the custard between the ramekins, ensuring that each one is filled right to the brim (it will shrink a bit as it cooks). Pour boiling water into the roasting tray so it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins carefully, ensuring that it doesn't splash INTO the ramekins. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the custard is just set.\r\n6. Remove from the oven, cool ramekins on a rack, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (They can be prepared up to 24 hours in advance.)\r\n7. To serve, sprinkle a 1mm layer of sugar over each ramekin, and blowtorch to melt the sugar. If you don't have a blowtorch, you can place it under a very hot grill, but watch carefully to make sure the sugar doesn't burn. Anyway, you should just go get yourself a blowtorch. They aren't that expensive and they're so much more fun! :)\n\r\n##Variations:\r\n- For black sesame cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, substitute the vanilla pod with 2 tbsp of black sesame paste, and increase the amount of sugar to 5 tbsp.

But it wasn\u2019t always that way. No one in my family cooked with a recipe, which I believe is par for the course among most people in the state. As a result, you\u2019d get a lot of variation in ingredients, cooking times and technique, depending on the person at the stove.\r\n\r\nMy mother, who has probably cooked the bulk of the jambalayas I\u2019ve eaten, was of the keep it simple school: chicken and/or andouille sausage, a diced onion, some Cajun seasoning and an always-fluctuating amount of long grain rice. She\u2019d throw it all into her skillet and stir and stir until the rice and meat were perfectly browned. Next came the water. Whether she used a coffee cup, highball glass, or Pyrex measuring cup, the rice always cooked through fluffy \u2014 never sticky or crunchy, the way some of my early jambalayas turned out \u2013 and the meat was juicy and flavorful. \r\n\r\nAt any rate, here is my best stab at telling you how to make what amounts to a savory, satisfying and simple meal.

Coat the bottom of a heated, 12-inch cast-iron skillet with oil.\n\r\n2. Brown the andouille, then set it aside.\n\r\n3. Brown the chicken, then set it aside.\n\r\n4. Add the diced onion, 2 cups of rice and garlic to the skillet, stirring the mixture continuously until the rice is browned, but not burned. This takes at least 20 minutes of elbow grease, so be sure to pour yourself a drink to pass the time.\n\r\n5. When the rice is browned, add the chicken and andouille back into the skillet, stirring the mixture until it is well incorporated.\n\r\n6. Add water to the mixture and stir it well, before adding Cajun seasoning to taste. Many jambalaya chefs add enough seasoning to make the water brown, but I say it\u2019s up to you.\n\r\n7. After the spice is added (a note on that later), stir the mixture again and bring it to a boil. Once the jambalaya comes up to a boil, turn down the heat to low before covering the skillet for about 15 minutes.\n\r\n8. Uncover the skillet and stir the mixture again, making sure that the rice isn\u2019t sticking to the bottom of the pot, and adjusting the seasoning as you see fit. Cover the mixture again for another 15 minutes.\n\r\n9. When the final 15 minutes is up, you should have a zesty dinner with perfectly fluffy, nutty-flavored rice.\n\r\nA note on seasoning: Cajun seasoning is a mix of cayenne, black pepper, white pepper, paprika, salt, thyme, parsley, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder. Brand to brand, these mixtures differ, so I tend to add pinches of the aforementioned ingredients to create a jambalaya that suits my palate. \n\r\nAnother note: I have spoken about variation in jambalaya recipes. Sometimes I add bell pepper and green onion at the rice browning stage when I\u2019m in the mood for a hint of sweetness in the dish. Other times I omit chicken and throw in about a pound of shrimp after the andouille and rice are browned."}

Dice the onions and finely chop the garlic.  Saute in a saucepan with some fresh marjoram until transparent.  Reserve half the onion and garlic in a separate bowl and add the can of tomatoes to the remaining onion in the saucepan.  Season with salt and pepper, add one teaspoon of tomato paste and simmer covered for half an hour.\n\r\n2.  To the reserved onion add in the meat, some finely chopped parsley, the breadcrumbs (just a couple of slices of white bread, crusts off and pulsed in a food processor), egg yolks and a dash of Worcestershire Sauce.  I use the yolks only as it makes for a rich and delicious hamburger.  Using whites tends to dry it out a bit.  Mix well, season with salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper and form into very thick hamburger patties the same diameter as the hamburger buns.  I usually leave the patties for about 30 minutes so that all the flavours come together, but it's not really necessary.\n\r\n3.  Heat some more oil in an oven-safe frypan  and brown the patties on both sides.  Either transfer the patties to small oven-safe tray or if the pan can fit in your oven just pour over the hot tomato sauce, cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes at 180C.  While the \"meatballs\" are cooking, you can prepare the Parmesan and Chili Fries (see separate recipe).\n\r\n4.  After 30 minutes, uncover the meatballs and top each one with a couple of thick slices of fresh mozzarella. Return to the oven for a further 5 minutes while you toast the buns.  The cheese will melt gloriously over the whole hamburger (not shown very well in the photo so the next time I make this I'll take a better shot).  It really does look amazing when you pull the tray out of the oven and there are 4 perfect patties swimming in a rich and flavourful tomato sauce and covered with melted fresh mozarella. Toast the buns under the grill until browned on both sides.  \n\r\n5.  Top each bun with a meatball hamburger, making sure to scoop up the the cheese and sauce with it.  Serve with the giardiniera, olives, sundried tomatoes and Parmesan and Chili Fries.\n\r\nI like the flavour of these just as is, without any other condiments or toppings.  I couple of nice butter lettuce leaves go quite nicely but I would recommend leaving it at that.  It doesn't really need mustard or mayonnaise or any other salad ingredients to detract from the taste of the meatball.  It's quite rich but the piquancy of the Giardiniera is a good foil for the richness.  But of course, don't eat this every day...\n\r\nMakes 4 medium-sized burgers."}

A partir de aquellas que me ha sido dado conocer y de m\u00faltiples intentos y variaciones desde que nuestros tajacarnes (pues tristemente son escasos o inexistentes los buenos carniceros en nuestras tierras) descubrieron tan \u00fatil forma de comerciar los jarretes de las j\u00f3venes reses gracias a que \u00e9stas (las j\u00f3venes reses) ingresaron a la fren\u00e9tica espiral de consumo de los absurdos cultores de la comida \"ligera\". En contraposici\u00f3n a esto enuncio una versi\u00f3n que recoge la tradici\u00f3n italiana y pretende hacer incalculable su contenido cal\u00f3rico. Las cantidades presentadas pueden ser suficientes para cuatro comensales de buen apetito.\n\r\nMarinar en fr\u00edo con una mezcla del jerez y unas gotas de salsa inglesa y dos ramitas de romero, las piezas de ossobucco durante una hora (no m\u00e1s para que el sabor de \u00e9sta marinada no opaque el de los acompa\u00f1amientos que llevar\u00e1 el plato).\n\n\r\n1.

Pasarlas por harina y sellarlas a fuego m\u00e1ximo en una sart\u00e9n levemente engrasada con aceite de oliva y reservar.\r\n2. En la misma sart\u00e9n, agregar una cucharada m\u00e1s de aceite de oliva y dos de mantequilla y rehogar durante un par de minutos la cebolla, la zanahoria y el apio con un poco de sal para que larguen sus jugos y remuevan el fondo de cocci\u00f3n del sellado de las piezas de carne.\r\n3. Incorporar a la sart\u00e9n el tomate concass\u00e9 y rehogar durante tres minutos m\u00e1s. Separar un espacio en el centro de la sart\u00e9n y verter all\u00ed la pasta de tomate (es ideal hacerlo as\u00ed para que el golpe t\u00e9rmico reduzca la acidez natural de la pasta de tomate).\r\n4. Mezclar bien y colocar nuevamente las piezas de ossobuco en medio de la salsa a la que puede agregarse un par de cucharadas de or\u00e9gano molido (al gusto) y una hoja de laurel.\r\n5. Aligerar la preparaci\u00f3n incorporando 1,5 cent\u00edmetros (medidos verticalmente) del caldo de pollo o ternera caliente (l\u00edqudo ligeramente por debajo de las piezas de carne) y continuar la cocci\u00f3n durante 10 minutos m\u00e1s.\r\n6. En una sart\u00e9n aparte desgrasar la tocineta, retirar el exceso de grasa y saltear con ella el hongo shitake durante un par de minutos para agregarlos luego a la sart\u00e9n que contiene las piezas de ossobucco y la salsa.\r\n7. Continuar la cocci\u00f3n durante una hora m\u00e1s (o hasta que la carne comience a desprenderse f\u00e1cilmente del hueso), esta parte de la cocci\u00f3n puede hacerse en el fuego directo de la hornilla o al horno cubriendo levemente con papel aluminio la sart\u00e9n. En ambos casos deber\u00e1 prestarse atenci\u00f3n a mezclar ocasionalmente y evitar que se evapore completamente el caldo agregando de acuerdo con la necesidad.\r\n8. Cuando la carne est\u00e9 alcanzando su punto, permitir la evaporaci\u00f3n de la salsa procurando que no se caramelice el fondo mezclando y removiendo los dep\u00f3sitos que pudieran formarse.\r\n9.

I placed mine into the freezer for about 30 minutes.\n\nTo create the dipping sauce, combine the remaining cup of coconut milk, flour, cinnamon, vanilla, cayenne and 2 tablespoons white sugar. Bring to a boil and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.\n\nFor the topping, place coconut, almonds, and sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in a 350 oven for 7-10 minutes, or until mix becomes lightly browned.\n\nI tried unwrapping one of the rice rolls and realized it probably wasn't going to work. It was very sticky and started to fall apart. I rolled it back up in the foil, then used a sharp knife to slice it into pieces. The foil gave it the stability it needed and cutting was much easier. Before serving, I sprinkled the tops with a bit of the topping. You can either drizzle the top with sauce or dip the roll into the sauce."}

You'll probably need about 15 medium sized strawberries to cover the top of the tart.  Put the berry flat side down on a cutting board and use your thumb and index finger to hold the widest part of the strawberry near the base.  Using a good sharp knife, cut the strawberries into thinnish slices.  Discard the ends.  (You can eat those as you go, yum!)  You should get about 4-5 slices per berry.  Fan the slices out and put them on the tart.  (It's better if you let the tart cool for a while.)  Work from the outside in, overlapping each the same way for the entire top.  For the center, choose a small berry and let the slices stand, like a flower.\n\r\nTo make them shine and to spruce up out-of-season berries, take 2 tablespoons of sugar and mix well with hot water (about 1/4 cup).  Brush the strawberries with the sugar glaze.  They will look AWESOME and smell really really good.\n\r\nEnjoy!\n\r\n(P.S. Thanks goes to Jai for great inspiration and basic recipe!!)"}

You mount the butter at the end, making a very rich luxurious silkiness that has an excellent mouthfeel. mmm! Be sure to use stainless steel, so your lemons don't taste metallic!Over a simmering double boil, whisk together the lemon juice, whole eggs, egg yolk, sugar and salt, in a stainless steel bowl. Whisk constantly until mixture is very thick and sexy-looking, about 10 minutes. Take off the heat and let cool for a bit, stirring every so often.Meanwhile, cut the butter into chunks (1-2 tbsp). Blend into cooled lemon mixture knob at a time until all incorporated. This takes some time. You will watch it become be pale, very thick, and silky to the touch. Work expeditiously: you don't want the butter to get too warm and 'break' your lemon cream. Either store it airtight in the fridge for later use, or use immediately by spreading it into your cooled tart crust, leveling the top, and chilling for a bit to set.To serve:Take the chill off the tart by setting at room temp for a bit, then whip up some cream with some confectioner's sugar until soft collapsing peaks form. Plop onto a slice, and garnish with a piece of candied ginger. Receive praise, thanks and accolades with humility and a secret thrill at just how much butter you've used.

Make a well in the centre and crack eggs into center. Using a fork beat the eggs. Bring the flour into the beaten eggs, little by little until the mixture gets so thick you're not in danger of having eggs spilling all over the table. Start using your hands (flour them) and bring all the flour in.\r\nKnead till elastic, sproingy, smooth and silky. Kneading developes the gluten in the dough.\r\nWrap it well in clingfilm and leave in fridge to rest for at least 30 mins.\r\nCut off about a fist-sized piece of dough. Leave the rest well covered in the clingwrap so it doesn't dry out. Start off with a smaller lump if you are unfamiliar with pasta rolling.\r\nDust with flour and pull it into a roughly rectangular shape. Squish one end thinner so it can be fed through the machine. Run it through the widest setting, then the second widest. Fold it in half and run it through widest setting, then second widest. Do this 3 or so more times until smooth and silky. This helps to work the dough and also give you a chance to neaten up the ends!\r\nAfter that work you way down through all the settings to the narrowest. Lightly dust the dough as you go to prevent stickage.\r\nNow to neaten up the ends. Fold the ends together, then fold lengthwise again and again until you have a roughly squarish package. At the widest setting, feed it through with the edge-that-used-to-be-the-sides first, so you end up with nice straight sides.\r\nWork down through all the settings again. For pappardelle, tagliatelle and lasagne you'll want something thicker (my machine has 7 settings and I stop at 2) and for ravioli and other stuffed pastas it's setting 1. Flour the finished products well!! It would be a pity to go though all that and then find they all stick together because you've been a bit stingy on the flour...\r\nIn my photo I've cut the pasta into rather wide pappardelle type strips. I was going to use it in a chunky tomato sauce and felt the more robust size would help add to the rustic feel of the dish."}

Heat up a fairly large saucepan, and pour a good glug of olive oil in. Roughly chop up the bacon, and run your knife through the rosemary (just to chop it up a little, don't bother about getting it too fine). Bosh the bacon and rosemary into the pan, and let it colour slightly, giving it a stir every now and then.\r\n2. Using the tip of a sharp knife, run the blade down one side of each sausage, then peel the skin off the sausage. Either using your hands or the knife, break it up into smaller bits, and mush it about a bit. When the bacon has gone a little golden, whack the sausagemeat in and give it a good stir to break up the chunks.\r\n3. When the sausagemeat is about halfway cooked through, add in the minced beef. Keep it moving around the pan to make sure you don't get chunks that are too big, or it'll be difficult to assemble your lasagne later on. When the beef is about 70% cooked, add in the wine, and turn the heat up to full whack and cook, stirring, until the wine has evaporated.\r\n4. Add in the tomatoes and tomato paste now, along with the oregano, thyme, nutmeg and cinnamon. Season well with salt and pepper (keep in mind that the bacon and sausagemeat are both rather salty too). Give it a really good stir, bring the mixture up to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting, partially cover it, and simmer for about 45 minutes.\r\n5. Towards the end of the 45 minutes, bring a saucepan of salted water to a rapid boil, and preheat your oven to about 150\u00b0C.\r\n6. Ladle out a just enough of the beef-and-tomato mixture to cover the base of an ovenproof dish, then cover it thinly with shredded mozzarella. Blanch 3 pasta sheets (or as many as you need to cover the dish in one layer) quickly, i.e. just for about 30 seconds to a minute: you just want to soften it. Lay these out over the cheese. Repeat the layering 2 or 3 more times, depending on how much meat sauce you have and the size of your baking dish. 3 layers is more than enough for me.\r\n7. Ensuring that you have enough meat sauce to cover the top layer very well, spread it out, making sure that the edges and all the bits of pasta are well covered, or they'll dry out and become hard. Cover the entire top with the rest of your shredded cheese, and bake, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes, or until the top is nicely golden brown and the pasta is fully cooked.\r\n8. Serve piping hot, with a scattering of freshly grated parmesan cheese."}

In the morning, punch down the dough and knead with wet hands.  You want to over knead this dough and make it wet in order to give it the chewy texture that English Muffins are supposed to have.  Continually wet your hands until the dough is very sticky.  Divide this sticky dough into eight globs.\n\r\n3. As best you can, form the wet globs into disks and lay them out on a clean surface dusted with cornmeal or flour so that they don't stick.  Let them sit until they have doubled.  (my dough was pretty cold so it took about 1 hour).\n\r\n4. Carefully without deflating the dough, transfer the disks to a preheated, dry, heavy skillet or frying pan. The frying pan should be set lower than you would for pancakes. Turn each muffin after five minutes - 10 minutes on each side - approx 20 minutes total cooking time.  If they cook too fast they will taste flat and doughy!\n\r\n5. Split the muffins by poking all around the edge with a fork and then pulling it apart on the last poke.

{"cook_time": "60 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "I was browsing through a junk sale here in Tokyo a while ago and happened to find a First Edition of the 1957 Sunset compliation cookbook, \"Cooking Bold and Fearless\".  The book is a collection of recipes sent in by the \"Chefs-of-the-West\"; male food enthusiasts from all walks of life, from pilots and retired military officers to plumbers and accountants, that submitted recipes to be published in Sunset magazine over the preceding decade. \r\n \r\nPost-war 1950's America is not really a place or period you would generally associate with male cooks, culinary experimentation or inter-cultural understanding (Arkansas was still using the National Guard to prevent blacks from enrolling in schools and Mickey Rooney was probably reading scripts to play Japanese stereotypes) but the recipes in this book show the desire of the contributors to explore other cultures and foods.  There are recipes for Spanish rice, Chinese ribs, Lebanese dips, Slavic borscht, Japanese tempura, French stews etc., all cobbled together from what these cooks could find in their 1950's supermarkets.\r\n \r\nSo in homage to that pioneering spirit, I made this using the kind of ingredients those 1950's cooks would have used, and put it together in the style of the time.  Economy of ingredients and processes; bold flavours, primary elements and a basic, geometric construction.  This was not a traditional Italian lasagne by any means, but it had a different kind of authenticity to it.  It genuinely tasted to me like how I would've imagined a 1950s Californian lasagna.  I loved it, and really enjoyed the process of making it. \r\n \r\nToday, an American lasagna differs from a traditional Italian lasagne in that the bechamel is replaced by a cottage cheese mixture (sometimes using eggs or shredded processed mozarella), but I think that was a development through the '70s, so this recipe uses a cheese sauce like I've seen in some earlier American lasagna recipes.  The original 1950 first edition of Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook had an American lasagna recipe but I have not been able to find it.  If anyone has that recipe I'd love to have a look at it.", "title": "1950's American Lasagna", "ingredients": ["Meat Sauce", "Vegetable Oil - Ground Beef - Onion - Garlic - Tinned Tomatoes - Dried Oregano - Dried Basil - Tomato Ketchup", "Cheese Sauce", "Butter - Flour - Milk - Dried Bay Leaf - Ground Nutmeg - Grated American Cheddar Cheese - Grated Parmesan Cheese", "Dried Lasagne Sheets"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/1950s-american-lasagna-1", "prep_time": "10 Min", "method": "1.  Start with the Meat Sauce.  Chop the onion and garlic and saute with oil in a pot or deep pan until softened.  Add in the ground beef and brown.  Add in the diced tinned tomatoes, dried herbs and ketchup.  Cover and simmer for an hour or so.\n\r\n2.  For the Cheese Sauce, start by heating some milk in a saucepan with the bay leaf and half an onion (unchopped).  Heat the butter in another saucepan and add in the flour when melted to make a firm paste.  Cook through for a minute or two (without browning) and add in the hot milk a little at a time, working it after each addition to make sure there are no lumps.  You need to cook the bechamel for around 20-30 minutes to cook out the raw flour flavour, so add more milk so that it doesn't become too thick.  After 20-30 minutes add in grated cheeses to taste and ground nutmeg.\n\r\n3.  Cook the lasagne sheets in boiling salted water for a few minutes until softened.  Lay these out on a damp towel while you wait.\n\r\n4.  Build the lasagne (in an oiled pyrex dish for added 1950's authenticity) with a layer of meat sauce, then cheese sauce, then pasta, etc.  End with a layer of cheese sauce and add more of both cheeses to the top.  Cover with foil and bake at 180C for around an hour, uncovering for the last 10-15 minutes to brown the cheese.  Let the lasagne cool out of the oven for 20 minutes or so before serving with a salad.\n\r\nEach of the recipes in the book were also signed by the contributors, so I thought I'd do that too.  Identity thieves please note that this is actually my real signature so I'd appreciate you not using it for forging cheques and buying imaginary houses and whatnot.  Thanks a bunch."}

Still, a hot wok indoors works just fine.\n\r\nThis is a fairly dry noodle dish so I don't like to overload the wok.  Just making one or two servings at a time is best, and it's so quick that it doesn't really matter if you do one at a time.  This is especially good if you're eating with vegetarians or people with different tastes.  One person might want meat, one might want seafood and another might just want vegetables.  For this I've just used prawn and squid.\n\r\n1.  Prep everything.  Wash and slice the vegetables, chop the garlic and slice the spring onions into one inch lengths.  Peel and butterfly the prawns and cut the squid into rectangles.  Break up the noodles, using a little cold water if necessary.  Cut the lemon into wedges.  Once everthing is prepped, clean up and make sure everything is on hand.  Once we start cooking it all happens pretty fast.\n\r\n2.  Heat the oil in the wok until smoking and add in the seafood.  Toss until almost cooked and then add in the garlic and then the vegetables (not the beansprouts) and spring onion.\n\r\n3.  Move everything to one side of the wok and crack in an egg.  Break up the egg with your wok tool and mix everything together.  \n\r\n4. Add in a handful of noodles and then pour in a little chicken stock, some light soy, a teaspoon or so of chilli powder (to taste), a little salt and white pepper and then the dark soy sauce.  Don't add too much chicken stock, as this is supposed to be a dry dish and you really want the dry fried taste to it.  It shouldn't be too wet.  Fry it all together and then throw in another handful of beansprouts.  They only take a few seconds to cook and when they're done, so are you.\n\r\n5.  Transfer it out to a bowl, add a wedge of lemon, some fresh coriander and some chilli oil or chilli sauce if using.\n\r\n6.  If it's just for one then sit down and enjoy it.

Allow 1 hour to ferment the poolish. Total preparation and baking time (not including fermenting the poolish or soaking the fruits): 7 hours, 15 minutes.\n\r\nMake and ferment the poolish (allow 1 hour): Combine the milk and yeast in a medium bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until yeast dissolves. Add the flour and stir until the mixture is the consistency of a batter, about 100 strokes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap, and put in a moderately warm (74-80\u00b0 F) draft-free place until it is puffy and domed.\n\r\nMix and knead the final dough (20 minutes): Measure the ingredients. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with a paddle blade. Beat on medium speed until smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using the tip of a small sharp knife, scrape the seeds out of the vanilla bean. Discard the pod. Add the poolish, eggs and egg yolks, salt and vanilla seeds; beat on medium speed 5 minutes, then gradually add 1 c. of the flour. Fit the mixer with the dough hook. Add 2 1/2 c. of the remaining flour and continue beating at medium speed for 10 minutes. Drain the fruit well, if necessary, and add, beating 2 minutes more. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, until smooth and slightly sticky, adding more flour if necessary, about 3 minutes.\n\r\nFerment the dough (about 2 1/2 hours): Shape the dough into a ball and place smooth side down in a well-buttered 6-qt. bowl. Turn the dough to coat the top with butter. Take the dough's temperature: the ideal is 78\u00b0 F. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and place in a moderately warm (74-80\u00b0 F) draft-free place until doubled in volume.\n\r\nNote: If the dough temperature is higher than 78\u00b0 F, put it in a cooler than 78\u00b0 F place like the refrigerator, until the dough cools to 78\u00b0 F. If it is lower than 78\u00b0 F, put it in a warmer than 78\u00b0 F place until the dough warms to 78\u00b0F. The point is to try to keep the dough at 78\u00b0 F during it fermentation. If you do have to move the dough, be gentle and don't jostle it, or the dough may deflate.\n\r\nDivide the dough and shape into a loaf (about 10 minutes): Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up on the sides. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly. Shape into a log.\n\r\nProof the loaf (2 to 3 hours): Butter a 10-inch springform pan or panettone pan. Press the loaf into the prepared pan. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74-80 degrees F) draft-free place until the dough rises nearly to the rim of the pan.\n\r\nBake the loaf (45 minutes): 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking, preheat the oven and homemade hearth or baking stone on the center rack of the oven to 400\u00b0 F. Bake 20 minutes. Cover the top loosely with foil and continue baking until the loaf is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and brush the top with the melted butter. Cool on a wire rack 20 minutes. Gently sprinkle some powdered sugar on top for a nice finish. Unmold and cool completely before serving. "}
{"cook_time": "25 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "This is a layman's version of a dish I had at a wonderful restaurant called Salt in Tokyo.  There, I had a dish which was pancetta-wrapped cod with vanilla, accompanied by a roasted fig.  It was absolutely, mind-blowingly delicious.  I tried to recreate it at home, but for this recipe I omitted the figs as I've never cooked with them before and I totally destroyed them.  What remained - the fish and the veg, was more than satisfactory, however.\r\n\r\nThe secret is in the vanilla, which doesn't lend too much flavour, but scents the dish with a welcoming, warming sweet smell, and the contrast between the salty pancetta and sweet, pan-roasted vegetables.  I used carrots and shallots here, but really any veg that has a natural sweetness would work well.  I think this would be equally great with a pumpkin or swede mash.", "title": "Pancetta-Wrapped Cod with Vanilla", "ingredients": ["For the cod", "a small, boneless cod fillet", "thin slices of pancetta, about 5 per piece of cod", "vanilla oil", "olive oil, butter", "splash of brandy", "For the veg (one portion", "1 carrot, diced", "4 or 5 shallots, halved", "2 cloves of garlic, peeled and whole", "fresh thyme leaves, a scattering", "olive oil, butter"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/pancetta-wrapped-cod-with-vanilla", "prep_time": "15 Min", "method": "1. Lay a piece of cling film down on a flat surface.  Line up your strips of pancetta so that they are just overlapping slightly.  Season the cod sparingly - you won't need too much salt as the pancetta is already salty, but a good grinding of black pepper wouldn't go amiss.  Lay the cod on top of the pancetta and dot with vanilla oil.  Fresh vanilla pod scrapings would be even better I imagine.  Carefully wrap the parcel using the cling film (a similar technique if you've ever made maki-zushi).  Wrap it evenly - if it's wrapped evenly, it will cook evenly.  Store it  wrapped in the fridge until you are ready - this will help it keep its shape.\n\r\n2. Heat some oil and butter in a pan and begin to roast off your carrots, shallots and garlic.  These will be cooking for a while on a low heat so you don't need to blanche the carrots first.  Season with salt and pepper and leave to bubble on the lowest heat possible.\n\r\n3. In another pan, you need to seal your cod parcel.  Remove the pancetta parcel from the cling film.  Heat some oil (and a little butter if you so please) to a fairly high heat, and let your parcel sit on the hot oil for a few seconds on each side.  Splash a bit of brandy on it and let it sizzle.  When you have sealed the parcel, you can do one of two things - transfer it to a preheated oven to cook through, or turn the heat right down and put the lid on the pan.  I did the latter (for lack of an oven) and it turned out just fine.\n\r\n4.  Your vegetables should be getting a little colour on them.  Toss in some fresh thyme leaves.  Remove the garlic from the pan - it has done its job now.\n\r\n5. After a few further minutes (6 - 7 is enough) of cooking, the cod parcel should be cooked through.  Remove it from the pan and let it rest for a minute or so.\n\r\n6. Spoon the veg onto a plate.  Decorate with a thyme sprig if you have one left over.  Slice the cod diagonally, breath in the sweet fragrance of the vanilla, roasted onion and thyme wafting up from the plate bfore you, drizzle with olive oil and serve.\n\r\n**Bonus Eats!**\n\r\nDon't throw away those garlic cloves that are now probably all soft and browned from the pan.

It will be tough to get off the grill and the dough may tear leaving you with a cheesy mess. Remember, you have another ball of dough waiting to be used, so don\u2019t overdo it. Cover your grill with the lid and just chill for a few seconds. Have a sip of beer or lemonade. Open lid and look at your pizza. Is this cheese all melty? Does it look delicious? If so, take it off the grill and serve; if not, put the lid back on and cook for a few minutes or keep the lid off to keep an eye on it. This is BBQing, not rocket science.\r\n5.

It's a safe and fairly easy way to control what goes into her body and ensure that she's getting the best tasting, best quality food she can.\n\nThis is more of a method than a recipe, exactly.  You can use any green, yellow or orange vegetable you like, any legume, or any fruit except citrus.  Just make sure you buy organic or locally grown, as they have the best nutritive value for your baby (not to mention it's a sustainable way to shop).\n\n- You'll steam most fruits and vegetables.  Cut them into even pieces, put them into a steamer basket over about an inch (3 cm) of boiling water, cover, and cook until a knife pierces the food easily.  Transfer to the bowl of your food processor, add water as necessary, and puree to an even consistency.\n\n- Bake starchy orange and yellow vegetables such as sweet potatoes or winter squashes.  Cut them in half, pierce the skins with a knife, place in a baking pan with a scant amount of water (1/4 inch or 1/2 cm) and bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for an hour or so (you can push the potatoes to 2 hours for optimum sweetness).  Remove the skins, drop the flesh in the food processor, add water, and puree.\n\n- Boil legumes before processing with a necessary amount of water (or organic whole-milk yogurt once your baby passes eight months).  Frozen green ones like sweet peas or edamame only need 3-5 minutes; dry brown and red ones will take longer.  You can mash the brown ones with a fork or potato masher for a more interesting texture.\n\n- You can also make meats for your baby at the eight-month mark.  Use lean organic meats like beef or chicken, poach them until just barely cooked through, and puree with water.\n\nPictured are carrots and green beans, cooked via the steamer method; edamame that have been boiled; canned red beans pureed directly from the can; and yogurt."}

Divide each baguette into three parts, I find this the most suitable for easy handling. You could of course just chop it in half, or into four.\r\n2. Using a pair of chopsticks (other utensils don't do the job as well), start digging the \"insides\" of the bread out, leaving 1/2 cm from the crust. You want it quite hollow. Don't throw the dug out stuff away. You'll still need it. \r\n3. Boil and mash the potatoes.\r\n4. Chop the \"bread innards\" up.\r\n5. In a GINORMOUS bowl, put the cream cheese and 1/2 cup of mayo in, and start creaming them together. It helps if the cheese is soft. \r\n6. Add salt and pepper.\r\n7. Chuck in the mashed potatoes, egg, sausages, and half of the chopped bread. Mix.\r\n8. Taste. Now, at this point, if the mixture is a bit dry, add more mayo or cheese. If it looks like it can take more chopped up bread, chuck in more. As I said, it all depend on YOU. \r\n9. Now for the OMG ITS SO BORING PART. I usually get the people who requested this bread to help me with it. Taking a spoon, scoop the mixture back into the hollowed out bread crust. You want the \"bread tube\" to be FIRM. And I mean FIRM. Squish as much mixture as you can into the tubes as humanely possible. If you divide the bread into three like me, the two ends are easier to do as no mix will fall off the other end. \r\n10. Wrap in aluminium foil. There's a trick to this, you can't just haphazardly wrap it up, you have to leave around 1/2 cm of \"breathing space\" surrounding the bread. According to mum, this is so more heat can circulate the bread, and makes it crispier on the outside. \r\n11. Bake in a preheated 180C oven for around 20-30 minutes. \r\n12. Slice into slices using a bread knife (Trust me, you don't want to use any other kind of knife.)\n\r\n1 loaf feeds around 4 girls, the other loaf is usually for breakkie the next morning.

Save the pastry cut out from making the holes to make lids for the vol au vents - try to keep its circular shape as you lift them onto the baking tray. (if you're still confused, it should all look like this: http://www.toomanychefs.com/images/rawrings.jpg)\r\n15. place pastry onto a non stick oven dish, then brush the pastry all over with beaten egg, place in oven for 15 - 20 mins or until golden brown. go back to chicken stew right after you put the pastries into the oven. \r\n16. make sure the heat is low on the hob and that the chicken stew is not bubbling. add a few more slivers of butter and pour the cream into the stew and slowly stir. make sure it stays at low heat to prevent the cream from curdling. season with a bit more thyme, chives and parsley to taste, then heat until pastries done. \r\n17. take out pastries when done and ladle the chicken and veg into the middle of the pastries even if it is puffed up. the weight of the chicken will push it down, while the walls will stay and support its structure."}

Probably because even though it is a simple recipe it has some tricky bits you have to handle carefully:\r\n\r\nGetting old enough potatoes. In most countries the only potatoes you can buy are young potatoes, while this recipe asks for older potatoes that can get golden when fried.\r\nBoiling and frying at the same time. While olive oil doesn't work well at high temperatures like peanut oil, it has a usually forgotten quality: it can boil at the same time it fries whatever you put in it. That is if you set the fire at that sweet spot, not too high, not too low. This allows the potatoes to both boil and fry.\r\nNot overcooking the eggs. It is fairly easy to let yourself go and fearing that the omelette might break you allow the eggs to form a thick, compact shape. But, as in its french counterpart, the beauty of the potato omelette happens when the insides are moist and almost difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nThere are different recipes in every town, and probably in every bar in Spain.

Before we opened each day we'd have a nice breakfast of rice, fried eggs, some sort of soybean sprout soup and excellent homemade kimchi.  My favorite kimchi was made of these peculiar small daikon (Japanese radish), and I had always wanted to eat them again, but I am never able to find them in the supermarket.  But one day I lucked out and bought all the ones they had on the shelf (at 298 yen/each!!)  It was the first and last time I made this kimchi as I haven't been able to track this radish down ever since.  But it was damn good.\r\n\r\nI like my small radish kimchi the way I like my men: long, hard and spicy.  Um, yeah, but of course you can adjust any of the spices to match your taste.

Then flip the filet and cook in the oven for another minute.\n\r\nThis usually ends up cooking the meat just the way I like it which is medium to medium rare and warm in the middle. But if you want to make sure you can use a meat thermometer and it should be at 130-140 F (55-60 C) for medium. There is no shame in using a thermometer. In fact, I recommend it for the first few times. Just make sure the tip of the thermometer gets to the center of the meat.\n\r\n8. IMPORTANT. After you've taken it out of the oven set it out and let the meat rest for about 5 minutes.\n\r\nYou can then serve the filet as is or cut it nicely. For this dish, I cut it into about half inch cuts against the grain (tho with a good piece of filet it shouldn't matter).\n\r\nI also served this with a red wine reduction:\n\r\n1. After you've set the meat to rest, pour red wine into the pan with all the good bits and dislodge the goodness with a wooden spoon. \n\r\n2. I also added a bit of grapeseed oil instead of butter and reduced the wine.\n\r\n3.

Put beans in 1/2 gallon container, fill with water, let soak overnight (12-24 hrs) in refrigerator.  In a pinch you can quick soak by bringing beans to a boil and then turning off the heat and letting them sit for an hour, but the overnight soak is better. Drain soaked beans and then place back in the pot.\n\r\n2. Cover beans with 2 inches of fresh water.  Add the uncut half of the onion, the epazote and the smoked ham hock. Bring beans to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally. The time it will take to cook the beans will depend on the freshness of the beans and the hardness of your water. If they\u2019re not completely cooked after an hour, let them simmer a while longer until they\u2019re done.\n\r\n3. Remove the ham hock then drain the beans, retaining 1 cup of the bean broth.\n\r\n4. Chop the slices of bacon and fry them in a skillet on medium until crispy and all the fat is rendered. Remove cooked pieces.  The bacon can be saved for later or eaten right away,  maybe use it on a salad.\n\r\n5. Fry the diced onion in the bacon grease for a couple of minutes, and then add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.  If you feel you need more fat, you can add a little olive oil.\n\r\n6. While the onion and garlic are saut\u00e9ing, take 2 cups of the cooked beans and place in a blender.  Add some of the bean broth and blend until you achieve a thick pasty soup consistency.  If you don't use all the retained broth, that\u2019s ok.\n\r\n7. When the onion and garlic is done, add the drained cooked beans into the skillet.  Keep stirring the mashed beans in the bacon fat until the texture is a chunky paste.  Add more bean broth if needed to get your desired texture.  Mix in the chili powder salt and pepper and serve with rice.\n\r\nMakes 4-6 servings.\n\r\nNotes: If you don\u2019t want to cook a pot of beans, two 16 oz. cans of cooked pintos can be used instead, but soaked beans taste better in my opinion.  If you want to slow-cook the beans, soak the beans for 8-10 hours in the refrigerator, then slow-cook them on low for 6-8 hours."}

I do it the day before, it keeps beautifully in the fridge.\n\r\nBut it's worth it, since your date put all those hours making herself look good just for your dinner :) Although she could kill you if she knew the calorie content of this cake...\n\r\nI had this really hard, green mango that I wanted to use, so I had to saute it in melted butter and muscovado sugar. The muscovado sugar brings out the vanilla taste and makes it more sexier.\n\r\n1) Bottom Layer:\r\nSet oven to 200\u00b0C\r\nCrush the digestives to a smooth mix, add melted butter, sugar and coconut. Mix and top of with cinnamon. You can do this in a blender if you're an lazy ass. But it looks cooler if you do it with a pestle and mortar.\n\r\nPour it in a cake form with a detachable rim. Pat it down to make an even bottom layer. Oven for 10 minutes (enjoy the smell of cookies from the oven).\n\r\nTake it out, set oven to 180\u00b0C. Let the bottom layer cool down.\n\r\n2) Middle layer:\r\nSeparate the eggwhite from yolk. Whip the eggwhite to a firm fluff (add some sugar, it helps).\r\nMix in a separate bowl - egg yolks, sugar, cream cheese. 1/2 the low fat vanilla cottage cheese, 1/2 of the sourcream (the rest goes to the top layer). \r\nMix until smooth using an electric mixer. \n\r\nAdd and carefully turn in the firm eggwhite-fluff into the cheese mix. DO NOT beat the mix, since you want keep the air in, making a fluffy middle layer.\n\r\nPour into the cake form, bake in oven for 45 minutes. The eggwhite-fluff will cause the cheese mix to rise, so you need to make sure the oven is a little below 180\u00b0C.\n\r\n3) Top layer:\r\nCut open the passion fruits. Use a spoon to transfer the inner pulp to a bowl. Beat the pulp with a whisk to release the seeds from the pulp. Enjoy the passion fruit fragrance filling your kitchen.\n\r\nCut and dice the mango into thin slices.\r\nWet the gelatin in cold water.\n\r\nMelt the butter in a pan. Melt the muscovado sugar in the butter.\r\nCut open the vanilla stick, extract the seeds with a sharp knife. Add the vanilla stick + seeds into the melted butter.\r\nCrank up the heat and add the chopped mango, stir fry until it softened (keep some raw for decorations). Add the gelatin, make sure it melts. Remove from heat, add the passionfruit and mix.\r\nThe mango / vanilla / muscovado sugar combination is a knock-out to balance the sourness from passionfruit.\n\r\nBy now you should see how that your cheesecake has risen in the oven. After 45 min (it should be firm atleast), take it out and let it cool down to roomtemperature. It will now have sunk down and make a nifty depression for you to add your passionfruit mix.\n\r\nBut before you do that, remember that you still have leftovers from the low fat cottage cheese / sourcream. Mix it and add it ontop of the cake. Smooth it out and carefully add the passionfruit mix. Add the leftover mango chunks on top. \r\nLet it stand in the fridge for atleast 30 min before serving."}

{"cook_time": "10 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "I'm crazy about dumplings of any kind, and one of my favourite things to do on a rainy weekend is to make a whole bunch of dumplings of various flavours.  They freeze extremely well and after a relaxing afternoon of dumpling making, you have a well stocked freezer and the security of knowing that for the next few months you are just minutes away from a delicious homemade dumpling feast at any time.  Dumpling Day should be a national holiday.\r\n\r\nThe secret to a good dumpling is the texture of the filling.  The filling should be firm, consistent and springy.  Too many homemade dumplings suffer from fillings that are separate and grainy, and which do not offer sufficient resistance to the teeth.  To make a delicious, springy dumpling we need to look at a chemical process called thermogelling.  In a nutshell, muscle fibres in meat and fish contain myofibrillary proteins known as actin and myosin.  In solution, these proteins form a gel which, when heated, traps water, fat and starch creating a springy and tender texture.  Creating a strong gel depends on a number of factors, including the concentration of these proteins, the temperature of the solution, its acidity and its salt content.\r\n\r\nSo how does this translate to Dumpling Day? It's all about creating the right environment for the formation of the gel, and ensuring that your filling has the right amount of water, fat and starch to create the right texture.", "title": "Dumpling Day", "ingredients": ["Basic Filling Mixture", "Minced Pork", "Onion (or spring/green onion", "Minced Garlic", "Grated Ginger", "Salt", "White Pepper", "White Vinegar", "Shaoxing Wine", "Soy sauce", "Cornstarch", "Dumpling Wrappers", "Premade wrappers are fine, but if you want to make your own it is not too hard.\u00a0 When buying premade wrappers, Gowgee, Jiaozi and Gyoza all refer to the same thing, but they are just the Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese pronunciations respectively.\u00a0 Wonton skins could also be used, depending on the type of dumpling you're trying to make", "Flavourings", "Chinese Cabbage", "Prawns", "Shiso (Perilla", "Nira", "Or anything else you like"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/dumpling-day", "prep_time": "60 Min", "method": "First, we need start in the morning with a basic pork mixture.  Take minced pork (I used about 1.5 kilos of medium fatty mince and ended up with more than 100 dumplings).  If you feel so inclined, you could run the meat through a mincer once or twice more to make sure it is very well minced.  The fattier the mince the more tender the filling will be, but if the mince is too fatty then there will not be enough actual meat (muscle) to release its myosin for creating the gel that gives the filling the right springiness.  Add to the meat some white vinegar (4 tbsp), shaoxing wine (2 tbsp), salt, white pepper, soy sauce (2 tbsp) and cornstarch (2 tbsp).  In a small food processor (or you could just finely chop everything together) I pureed half a large onion (you could finely chop a small bunch of spring onion instead), 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and 5cms of grated ginger and added it to the pork.  Using your hands, mix everything together and knead the mixture very firmly for about 20 minutes.  The kneading process is vital, as it releases the myofibrillary protein from its muscular organisation and allows the creation of the gelatinized network that gives you a springy filling.  Set this aside in the fridge while you prepare your flavourings.\n\r\nOf course, you can just make plain dumplings, but I like to have a bit of variety.  Any kind of additional flavouring is fine.  Today, I made separate batches with prawn, shiso (perilla), nira (I think this is called 'chinese chives' in the west), and Hakusai ('bai cai' or 'chinese cabbage'').  You could also use shiitake, chili, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, coriander, pea shoots... anything really.\n\r\n Finely chop the prawns, almost to a puree.  I used a food processor.  Roughly chop the chinese cabbage and boil in salted water for around 5 minutes.  Drain, transfer to a  board and very finely chop.  Then places the mixture in a clean tea towel and squeeze out all the remaining liquid.  For the nira, I chopped it to around 2 cms in length, boiled for 2-3 minutes and again squeezed out all the moisture.  The shiso doesn't need to be pre-cooked and you can just slice this very finely.  To do this, halve a stack of leaves along the rib, roll up each stack of halves (lengthways) and very finely julienne.\n\r\nSeparate your flavourings into separate bowls and add to them the basic pork mixture.  Now take turns with each flavouring, transferring it to your big mixing bowl and kneading until the flavourings are all combined and the mixture becomes springy - around 5 minutes for each batch.  Transfer all your bowls of mixture to the fridge and let it rest for a few hours to allow the gel network to form.  The saltiness of the mixture and the acidity of the vinegar provide a suitable environment for this process.  With the prawns, you have added additional myosin from the prawn meat, so you may notice this mixture becoming very springy, almost to the point of being 'bouncy'.\n\r\nAfter a few hours it's time to make your dumplings.  I won't go into dumpling folding methods (maybe another time), but you can make wontons, jiaozi, pleated gyoza or simple dumplings for boiling... whatever takes your fancy.  For me, I usually make these dumplings in broth so I use a very simple fold that looks fine in soup or boiled.  If you wanted to make dumplings for frying (like gyoza) or steaming (like xiaolongbao/shourumpo), then you may prefer a slightly more attractive shape.  You can even just leave them as half moons, like some Japanese or Korean dumplings.\n\r\nMy method is to take a gyoza wrapper, place about a teaspoon of dumpling filling in the centre.  Dip your finger in a bowl of water and wet the top half edge of the wrapper and fold the bottom half up into a half-moon shape, making sure that the filling is centred, and that there is no air trapped in the wrapper.  Then wet the very top of the half-moon and fold each end up to the centre.  Store on a tray (making sure they don't touch each other) and then when each batch is finished, transfer the tray to the freezer.\n\r\nWhen they're well frozen, transfer each batch to a large ziplock bag marked with the corresponding flavour and continue to store in the freezer.\n\r\nTo cook, you can boil the frozen dumplings in salted water or stock for about 10 minutes, or steam them for about 12-15, or even fry them (as for gyoza) or deep fry them.  Bear in mind though that the difference between these and commercially frozen dumplings (aside from tasting much better and not containing any of the chemical additives) is that firstly, they don't contain preservatives so they will not last as long in the freezer and secondly, the filling is not pre-cooked, so you need to make sure they are cooked all the way through.\n\r\nPersonally, I usually steam or boil them for a snack served with some chili oil and black vinegar, or add them to broth for a dumpling soup breakfast.  There's nothing quite like a homemade dumpling, so set aside a day of your weekend for the mental therapy of Dumpling Day."}

Stir together until it's combined enough to work with your hands. \n\r\nKnead the dough adding flour until you've got a stiff dough that won't tear easily when stretched. You should be able to get it relatively thin when stretching. Knead around 10 minutes.\n\r\nAfter kneading, coat with a little olive oil and let sit in the bowl for around 30 minutes or until it nearly doubles in size. \n\r\nMake balls with the dough about 2-3 cm in size (about an inch). Smooth it out by making a circle with your thumb and index finger and pushing the center through, stuffing the outer lip into itself. Using your fingers start to flatten a couple into a small circle. Take a rolling pin or long, thick stick and flatten as much as you can get it without it tearing. It'll fry quite quickly so to make sure the dough cooks evenly you'll need it thin. To keep it circular roll over half and rotate the dough slightly (same idea as making gyoza wrappers) \n\r\nSpoon on your sauce, cheese, herbs, and any other fillings you want. Add another round of dough on top and seal the sides firmly with your fingers so oil doesn't get it (that baby will splatter like Sylvester cat on crack if you don't).\n\r\nDeep fry or pan fry in a few centimeters of oil. If deep frying, splash some of the oil on the top to more evenly cook it. If you've made it thin enough the insides should be cooked by the time it's browned, but if not turn down the heat down a bit so the dough can cook through.\n\r\nPut on a drying rack or in paper towels to get rid of excess oil. Serve soon after. \n\r\nNotes: Above is the basic cheese and sauce combo. Feel free to any other fillings to personalize."}

WHILE you're doing this watch your bread - you want your bread to get a golden/darkened hue / crispy around the EDGES - this will allow the middle of your bread to retain a nice softness and not be too crunch and dry. This will also allow the bread to absorb the oil/spices dripping from the Portobello.

Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C.\r\n2. Using a food processor (or a large ziplock bag and a rolling pin - I prefer this way, less clean up and stress relief!), blitz up the digestive biscuits until they're pretty finely crumbled. Melt the butter in the microwave or over the stove, and stir it into the butter. There should be just enough to bind the crumbs together.\r\n2. If using a springform pan, grease the base and sides well and line the base with greaseproof paper, and pack the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan. If using a pie tin, grease it liberally and pack the crumb mixture over the botom and around the sides. Place the springform pan/pie tin into the fridge until ready to use.\r\n4. Squish up the cream cheese with a spatula, and place in the bowl of a standing mixer. I would seriously recommend NOT doing this by hand - I did it once and couldn't brush my teeth the next day. Cream the cream cheese until it's light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Add in the sugar and beat on high until dissolved into the cream cheese, another 5 minutes. Add in the eggs, and beat until smooth, 3 minutes or so).\r\n5. Pour the cheese mixture into the pie tin/springform pan and bake for 40 minutes, or until the middle is set and the top is golden brown. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before serving, then slather on the strawberry/blueberry preserve before slicing.\n\r\nThis cheesecake keeps well for about 5 days to a week in the fridge in a tightly covered container. I personally prefer it after it's been refrigerated for a couple of hours, as its denser that way."}

But roughly, this serves 2"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/jamies-caesar-salad", "prep_time": "10 Min", "method": "Dressing: \n\r\n1. Using a mortar and pestle bash up a couple of anchovies. Grate a whole pile of parmesan cheese into it. Add about 2 large dollops of creme fraiche. \r\n2. Give it a good lug of olive oil, then add the lemon juice. Ratio of oil to juice should be about 1:4. Season with pepper (no salt, anchovies salty enough) and bash it up well till creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust. \n\r\n- dressings should be just a bit on the sour/salty side, as it's got to be still tasty once it's mixed in with all the leaves.\n\n\r\nCoddled egg:\n\r\nCoddle your eggs using your method of choice. I like my yolks liquidy and only just cooked. I suggest using the Chinese steamboat style of doing it. Use a ladle which has holes in it, like for steamboat. The ladle will hold the egg white bits together while it cooks solid, and the water swishing around will ensure the egg doesn't stick to your ladle.\n\r\n1. Boil a pot of water. Salt it and add vinegar to the water. The vinegar helps to set the yolk. \r\n2. Crack egg into small bowl (don't break the yolk!!) so it's easier to pour it. Hold the ladle so the top of it is about the same level as the water surface. \r\n3. Gently pour the egg into the ladle. Hold your ladle there for 2 minutes or so depending on how cooked you like your egg. \n\n\r\nSalad:\n\r\n1. Cut chicken thigh away from drumstick. Make incisions all over meat. \r\n2. Rub finely chopped sage and salt/pepper into chicken, particularly into the incisions so the flavour sinks in. Glug olive oil all over so chicken is well coated and dripping with oil. \r\n3. Place ciabatta in baking pan. Drizzle olive oil all over bread, season with pepper/salt. Place meat all over bread and bake in a fan oven until fully tender, turning it over at half time. When it\u2019s done it should be easy to fork the meat off the bone. Shred the meat a little bit so it\u2019s in bite-size chunks. \r\n4. Lay the prosciutto over the bread after the cooked chicken has been taken off. Put it back in the often to crisp up the prosciutto. Turn the heat on low so you get a fully crispy un-burnt meat fritter. \n\r\n- Don't worry about the bread being soggy when you take the chicken off - it's the juices from the chicken, which will evaporate off as the prosciutto bakes.\r\n- You may like to cut prosciutto into smaller strips before baking.

I woke up this morning with nothing to eat and I realised that I had leftover tartare sauce and a wok full of oil from the Fish & Chips I made yesterday.  I've always been a big fan of Chicken Nanban so I thought I'd give this a try.\r\n\r\nGoogle tells me that \"nanban\" translates to \"Southern Barbarian\" referring to the history of this dish, which was adapted from the Portuguese *escabeche* where fried fish were pickled in vinegar for sea voyages.  Early Portuguese sailors brought this to Japan and *nanban-zuke* is a fairly common method of preserving horse mackarel in the Miyazaki area.  The original Chicken Nanban was developed at the Ogura resturant in Miyazaki city in 1956 and consisted of fried chicken steeped in a rice vinegar solution.  This is one part of Japanese cuisine I don't really get - soaking deep fried things so that they become soggy.    To me, deep frying is all about the crispness so  I thought I would do this chicken dish a little differently.", "title": "The New Kurozu Nanban", "ingredients": ["For the chicken", "Chicken Thigh Fillet (boneless and skinless, trimmed of visible fat - I don't think you need the skin for this recipe but you could keep it on if preferred", "Nihonshu (sake", "Chopped garlic or garlic powder", "White pepper", "Cornflour and Plain Flour", "For The Glaze", "Black vinegar (any kind, I used the Chinese Chinkiang variety", "Sugar (I used palm sugar but any kind will do I think", "Soy sauce", "Plus tartare sauce to serve.

First marinade the chicken in some nihonshu (sake), some garlic powder and white pepper.  Leave in the marinade for around half an hour.\n\r\n2.  Sift together equal parts of cornflour and plain flour.  Season well with salt and white pepper.\n\r\n3.  To make the glaze, in a small saucepan add a few tablespoons of black vinegar, a tablespoon or so of soy and a tablespoon of sugar.  Add a dash of vegetable oil and little water and then bring to a simmer.  The glaze is done when it is glossy and slightly sticky.  Be careful not to burn it as once the sugar caramelises it will turn quickly.  Of course, as everything is black anyway you can't tell so you just have to estimate when to stop from the consistency and the aroma.\n\r\n4. While the glaze is simmering, heat your oil to around medium heat.  The chicken will take around 6-8 minutes to cook so keep the heat moderate so as not to over-brown the crust.\n\r\n5.  Dredge the chicken in flour and add to the hot oil.  The chicken is done when it floats and is a light golden colour, probably around 6 minutes or so if it's quite a thick thigh fillet.  Set aside the chicken to rest a few minutes.\n\r\n6.  To serve, drizzle the chicken with the hot glaze, slice and serve on a plate with plenty of tartare sauce."}

Give this ~30 minutes. Chop half of bay, oregano, basil, quite finely.\n\r\nPour lots of chicken broth into decent sized pot, start to heat on high, add some fresh bay leaves, basil, and oregano. Do not boil, once well heated, reduce to low heat.\n\r\nChop shallots medium fine. Melt 2tbsp butter in risotto pan. Add shallots when butter has melted and heated, but before brown. Add some salt and pepper. Allow shallots to start to brown, but not heavily. Add risotto, make sure all rice gets covered with butter and toasts lightly (2-3 min).\n\r\nAdd ~1cup of vermouth (can substitute with white wine, but i prefer the flavor the vermouth eventually gives. fyi - doesn't smell all that good at first). Stir briskly, making sure rice isn't sticking, and keep stirring until vermouth is almost completely absorbed.\n\r\nNow start to add the chicken broth one cup at a time (or one ladel's worth, etc) and stir. Don't want the risotto to get too dry, or to have it swimming in too much liquid. This is where the love comes in. Add the quartered mushrooms, then, as you're adding liquid, add the chopped herbs, and stir. Once you realize you're half way through the chicken broth, add strained porcini juice, then your \"other\" mushroom type juice. You can discard the mushrooms,  Now start SLOWLY adding some parmesan cheese, just a pinch at a time, ah yes, and stir... Finish adding the chicken broth as the liquid gets absorbed, and keep adding the cheese. You'll notice it getting creamier and creamier, as you stir... Step 5 takes 20-35 minutes. (NEW NOTE: The timing of adding the mushroom juice is crucial to the ending flavor. If you want a powerful mushroom flavor, add it at the end, more subtle, at the beginning. What I've done lately is add the porcini at the beginning so the risotto has a good mushroom base, then add your more distinct ie. more expensive, mushroom towards the end. You'll get a rich flavor overall, but with the specific hints of the final mushroom.)\n\r\nNow you're at a decision point. Most risotto recipes call for you to stop at this point, leaving the rice a bit firm. Personally, i prefer very tender rice, so i keep cooking. My total cook time is probably 70-75 minutes. If you like it a bit harder, you're looking at 45-55 minutes.\n\r\nYou can leave some liquid in the pot, it will continue to absorb into the rice. I also find it nice to have some liquid to dip my bread in...\n\r\nServe either in a large bowl for family style or spoon onto individual plates. Top with a dash of cheese. Enjoy!"}

If you can find them, you should definitely buy them, and let me know where I can get more, ours is a bit old now, and a tad worse for wear, but we\u2019ve not been able to find any of them anywhere\u2026\r\n9. Place your full baking tray in the oven, and bake for 10 - 13 mins, or until they\u2019re just turning golden.\r\n10. Whilst they\u2019re cooking, work on rolling and cutting the rest of the dough.\r\n11. You might want to leave the cookies to cool slightly on a wire rack after you\u2019ve taken them out of the oven. Eat a couple, just to check they\u2019re ok, of course.\r\n12. You don\u2019t have to give the biscuits away, you could just snarf them all by yourself, but this recipe makes\u2026 uh, loads (30-odd, depending on the size of your cutters and how thinly you roll.)\u2026 and I love giving them away to friends."}

{"cook_time": "20 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "While all of us surely love our lobster ravioli, truffle oil, shavings of truffles encased in sheets of freshly made pasta, foie terrines, and other fussy dishes, sometimes it's hard to beat a well made, silken, custardy carbonara. The problem is, many restaurants don't seem to be able to put out a halfway decent one! Either the noodles are overcooked, the bacon's too salty, or the eggs have scrambled. Which means that whenever I want this, I tend to make it on my own. So I'm lucky that it's so ridiculously simple to make.\r\n\r\nThe basic \"formula\" for this is 100g of dried pasta, 1 egg yolk, 50mils of cream, and 20-30g of parmesan. And while the meat in question is usually thickly sliced bacon lardons, I'm using some chorizo here that I got from a recent trip to Barcelona, which is an intensely smoky, flavourful and fragrant dry cured sausage, to give it a slightly Spanish twist. What I love about chorizo is that the smoked paprika used in seasoning the sausage bleeds red into the oil that's rendered out as you heat it, which in turn imparts a deep orange hue to the sauce. Of course, if you don't have chorizo, bacon will do great (that's the classic way after all), otherwise another twist I love is using meatballs made from sausagemeat (a herby, garlicky one works best for me) which you saut\u00e9 with the bacon until its fully cooked before adding the noodles in.\r\n\r\nI hope you try it and love it as much as I do, 'cos that'll mean you never have to face another sad restaurant-style excuse of a carbonara again. Oh and by the way, do yourself a favour and leave out those frozen peas ;)", "title": "Chorizo Carbonara", "ingredients": ["6 thick slices of chorizo, cut on the bias", "1 tsp olive oil", "200g dried pasta e.g. linguine", "2 large egg yolks", "100ml cream", "50g freshly grated parmesan, plus a little extra for sprinkling", "salt & pepper", "chopped flat-leaf parsley (optional"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/chorizo-carbonara", "prep_time": "10 Min", "method": "Bring a deep pot of water to the boil, and salt it generously (it should taste like the sea).\r\nCut the chorizo slices into quarters (alternatively you could just use very thin slices, but I like it this way cos then you have the crispy outside but chewy interior). Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat and gently fry the chorizo to render out some oil and heat it through, giving the pan a couple of good tosses.\r\nCook the pasta until it's just al dente.\r\nWhile the pasta is cooking, whisk together the cream, egg yolks, and parmesan. Season this mix well with pepper, but leave the salting till later - the parmesan and sausages are both salty, so it's best to correct the seasoning at the end.\r\nWhen the pasta is al dente, drain it and add it to the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat, then pour in the egg mix, tossing carefully so each noodle is coated in the sauce. The residual heat from the pan and the noodles will cook the eggs but shouldn't make them curdle. Taste, correct the seasoning if necessary, then serve immediately with extra parmesan on the side and sprinkled with parsley if desired."}

Saw off the rounded ends of your quails eggs with a serrated knife, and place them in individual saucers. Bring a deep pot of water (at least 8-10cm deep) to the boil and add 2 tbsp of vinegar. This will help the egg whites to coagulate. When it starts to boil, gently tip one saucer at a time into the water where the bubbles are, then use a spoon to swirl the water around the egg to create a \u2018whirlpool\u2019. Let it cook for about 45 seconds over medium-low heat, and when cooked (press gently on the yolk to ascertain if it is done to your liking), remove using a slotted spoon, and transfer to an ice bath to arrest the cooking process.\n2. Repeat with the rest of the eggs. When all the eggs are cooked, use a small knife to trim the edges. This can be done up to 2 days in advance and stored in the fridge in a bowl of cold water.\n3. Make the hollandaise by mixing the white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp cold water and the crushed white peppercorns in a small saucepan. Reduce by one third, and leave to cool. Add the egg yolk to the cold reduction and whisk. Place the saucepan on a heat diffuser and whisk continuously until the sauce emulsifies, becoming smooth and creamy after 8-10 minutes, with the heat gradually increasing. Do not allow the temperature to rise above 65C.\n4. Remove the pan from the heat, and - still whisking - drizzle the tepid clarified butter in a steady stream. Stir in the lemon juice, and pass the sauce through a muslin lined chinois to eliminate the peppercorns. Season with salt and white pepper to taste and set aside.\n5. Use a 4cm pastry cutter and cut two rounds from each slice of bread. Toast the bread lightly on both sides until golden, then brush one side with the melted butter and keep warm.\n6. Heat a small saucepan of water to a simmer, then immerse all the eggs in for 10-15 seconds, just to warm through.\n7. To serve, place one toasted round on each plate, buttered side up. Top with two poached quails eggs. Cover half of each quails egg with some Hollandaise, then serve \na little extra on the side in a small spoon. Garnish with chives.\n\nOptional: You can even grill two rashers of bacon (each halved) until crisp, and include it in your mini eggs benedict between the bread and eggs!"}

I'd always go to a restaurant or depend on a friend's mom to have this dish, and it wasn't until about a month ago that I HAD to make it for myself. Due to today's Life 2.0 pace, I had to make it quicker. \n\n1. On a hot pan put a little oil and brown the pork on all sides. I use a bit of salt and pepper to get the flavor going.\n\n2. When browned gently transfer the pork to a pressure cooker and add the sake, ginger, green onion and put enough water to cover the pork. Whack on the pressure cooker lid and set it on high until the pressure release is piping on a steady rate. At this point, reduce the heat to medium and let it do it's thing for 30 minutes.\n\n3. When the 30 minutes are up, run cold water over the pressure cooker to lower the pressure and safely remove the lid. You should at that very moment get a wonderful aroma of sake, ginger and pork. Beautimus.\n\n4. At this point, I gingerly transfer the pork to a seperate place (be careful, they are pretty damn soft at this point) and strain the cooked sauce to get the ginger and green onion bits out and transfer some of the broth back into the pot (I saved about 1/2 for future use).\n\n5. Put the pork back into the pot with the broth and add the soy sauce, mirin, sugar and radish (you can at this point also put soft- boiled peeled eggs). With the lid off, let it simmer for about an hour. \n\n6. When the sauce has reduced a bit and everything has a wonderful caramely color. Serve and enjoy.\n\nThe only downside of the pressure cooked version is that it somewhat beats up the pork. But I think the for the quickness, it's worth it.\n\n*I can't believe I used the term \"Life 2.0\"."}

If you can't get either of those you could probably also substitute any edible fresh green leaf, e.g. large baby spinach leaves or something), top each leaf with a teaspoon or so of the sticky sambal and place a prawn on top of each leaf.  Squeeze over a few drops of fresh lime and from a squeeze bottle or off the end of a spoon drizzle over a touch more of the black caramel sauce, sprinkle with some additional crushed peanuts and a few reserved coriander leaves.

Salty lemons?  Why?\r\n\r\nLast month I was strolling through my local supermarket and noticed big bags of organic lemons on sale.  I picked up a few bags and decided to give preserving lemons a try.  I've gone for basic preserved lemons without adding any spices.  I don't think they're necessary but I might try that at some later stage.\r\n\r\nIf you've never tried preserved lemons before, do yourself a favour.  I was absolutely amazed.

Quarter the lemons to within a half inch of the base, leaving them attached.  I also cut some of the lemons through into quarters so that they can take up the spaces in the jar that a whole lemon won't fit into.  I haven't noticed any difference in the taste or texture of the different cuts.  Leave some lemons aside and juice them.  You will need this juice to top up the jar to fully cover the lemons in the brine.\n\r\n3.  Sprinkle a handful of salt into the base of your jar and start adding the lemons.  tuff as much salt into the cavities of the attached lemons as the lemons will hold and press salt onto the flesh of the fully cut quarters.  As you add them to the jar, squash them down to release the juices.  Use the fully quartered lemons to take up any smaller spaces in the jar, adding more salt around the lemons as you add them.\n\r\n4.  When the jar is full, top with another handful of salt and add additional lemon juice to make sure that all the lemons are fully covered.  Leave an air space at the top of the jar.  Seal it up and leave out of the sun for at least 3 weeks before using.  They are better after a month or so and they apparently should keep out of the fridge for about 6 months.\n\r\nAs the lemons release their oils to the brine, it will take on a thick, sticky texture.  Some people report a lacy white film around the lemons.  I haven't noticed anything like that but it is apparently quite harmless and can simply be rinsed away.\n\r\nWhen ready the rind is soft and comes away from the flesh and pith very easily.  This is the part you're mainly after, although the flesh is quite tasty also and could be used for some purposes.  The pith isn't really good for anything. To use the lemons, just take them out of the jar with a non-reactive utensil and rise under cold water to wash away the brine. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh and pith.  \n\r\nPreserved lemons are a staple in North African cooking and are used in tagines and stews mainly, but stay tuned for some other recipes.  Think of them like brined olives, as they are similar in saltiness and texture.  \n\r\nI am seriously in love with these lemons at the moment.  I will confess to just eating them as is, but I think you could use them just about anywhere.  Salads, tagines, sauces, roasted meats...  possibly even martinis?"}

Super yummy. The best part about making duck confit for me - apart from eating it, that is - is that I get to eat potatoes fried in duck fat!

Remove the legs and breasts from the ducks, and set aside. (Breasts can be frozen for later use.) Remove all the skin and fat from the ducks and place into a heavy-based saucepan. Cut up the carcasses and place in an oven (at about 180\u00b0C) in a roasting tray together with all the wings etc for about 40 minutes.\r\n2. Rub about 4-5 tbsp of salt on the duck legs, putting more salt on the skin side. Rub in about 2 tbsp of pepper as well. Place the legs in a single, snug layer - skin side up - in an ovenproof dish/pan. (The dish should be deep enough so that there's at least 2 inches of space above the ducks.) Scatter the peel of one orange, and all the garlic on top of the duck. Seal tightly with clingfilm and keep in the fridge for 24 hours.\r\n3. Cut the fat up into small pieces, and place the saucepan over medium heat to render the fat. If there is a lot of fat, you can strain the oil out periodically. Keep heating it until all the fat and skin looks crispy, and you can't render anymore fat out. Strain through a chinois, pressing with the back of a wooden spoon to squeeze out every last bit of fat. Cover the container and keep in the fridge until ready to use. (You should be able to get about 3 cups of fat.)\r\n4. Remove the roasting tray from the oven, and place the bones and meat into a stock pot. Pour all the fat out, and strain it twice through a chinois, then using a muslin cloth to remove the impurities. Add this to the oil rendered from the skin and fat.\r\n5. Place about 1-2 cups of water into the roasting tray, and heat it over the stove, scraping all the bits from the bottom. Pour it all into the stock pot over the bones. Add the mirepoix in, and top up the water so it covers all the bones. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat to the lowest and simmer for 3-4 hours, skimming all the impurities off. Remove the bones, strain, then keep the stock in the refrigerator or freezer. (You can use it as the base of a soup, or reduce and make a sauce.)\r\n6. After 24 hours in the fridge, the duck legs will look wet, as the water has been drawn out by the salt. Discard the orange peel and garlic cloves. Pat the duck legs dry with kitchen paper, and place back into the dish, in a snug single layer, skin-side up again.\r\n7. Heat the rendered fat over low heat in a small saucepan until it is completely melted (it would have solidified in the fridge).\r\n8. Remove the peel of the second orange with a peeler, and place the peel onto a medium sheet of muslin. Place the cinnamon quill, star anise, shallot and some black peppercorns (about 1 tbsp should suffice) onto the muslin, then gather up the edges and tie securely with kitchen twine. Tie the second head of garlic into another muslin-bag.\r\n9. Place the two muslin bags into the dish, and pour over the melted duck fat. Place in a preheated oven at 125\u00b0C, and cook for 3-5 hours. The meat should come off the bone very easily by the time it's done.\r\n10. Remove the duck legs carefully from the dish, and place into another container. Strain the oil, and pour enough in to just submerge the duck legs. Let it cool, then cover tightly and refrigerate. It will keep in the fridge for about 6 weeks. The rest of the duck fat can be strained and kept separately if desired.\r\n11. To serve, remove the duck legs from the fat, brush off the oil, and heat up about 1/4 cup of the duck fat in a large heavy-based skillet. (You want it to almost deep fry.) Place the ducks skin side down in the hot fat, and fry until the skin is crispy. Turn over and cook for one additional minute on the other side.\r\n12. Place the reheated ducks on a tray, and keep these in an oven preheated to 120\u00b0C.\r\n13. Top up the fat if necessary, then fry some parboiled sliced potatoes in the duck fat until golden and crispy on both sides. Serve with the duck legs and a glaze made with balsamic vinegar, the jus from the duck carcasses, and the juice from one or two oranges, reduced until syruppy.\r\n14.

Start with the butter:  Place butter in room temperature until you can knead it gently into a rectangular shape (~A4) over a piece of parchment paper (double size of an A4).  Place the butter in between the paper and refrigerate it until it's semi-hard. \n\r\n2.  The Dough:  Microwave the milk to lurk warm (over done it will kill the yeast), sprinkle and stir in the yeast then combine with sugar, eggs, oil, flour and salt. Knead lightly and adjust the softness with flour. Let it rest for an hour until double in size (1 - 1.5 hours), then punch it and put it back to the fridge (30 mins).  Roll the dough into double-A4 size and place the butter on either side and seal the dough.  You want to wrap the butter block with the dough evenly.  Try stretching the dough evenly and be careful not to break it.  \n\n\r\n3.  Folding the Dough:  Roll out the now A4 dough, when it's thin enough (1 cm), fold them into three fold  (like how you fold banknotes into Lei See Packet.  Well if you're Western - like folding Business letter).  Remember to dust the working space with flour or it'd stick and you will want to die.  Roll it flat again until 1 cm thin, and fold it again.\n\r\n4.  Chill the Dough:  Now retrain yourself and stop folding (I know it's fun) - It's very important to tuck the dough back to the fridge (wrap in parchment paper to prevent drying).  If you don't and keep on folding it, the butter melts and the croissant will not come out fluffy.\n\r\n5.  Repeat steps 3-4 one - two more times and 30 mins chilling in between.  Cover in foil and chill over night.  The dough will grow a bit so don't wrap it too tight.\n\r\n6. Shaping the Croissant:  Roll the dough, and cut it in half for easier handling, and roll it to a scandalous 3 mm thin.  Shape it into tissue paper size, and cut it diagonally.  with the tip facing against you, roll the the triangle upwards.  \n\r\n7.  Mine turned out to be phallic because I didn't secure the middle tip under the croissant when I baked it.  If you want a decent croissant, seal the middle tip under when tuck in the oven :)\n\r\n8.  Beat the egg, and brush it over the croissants.  Cover with parchment paper and let it rest for an hour (don't skip this step, because the yeast will create air during the rest, making the croissant fluffy).  Preheat the over with a 100C, tuck the croissant in, and turn up to 130C, for about 15-20 mins.\n\r\n9.  Now brew your coffee\n\r\n10.  Think of what you are going to be in a year time.\n\r\n11.  And enjoy the croissant!\n\r\n12.  What's good about the dough despite all the hardwork is - you can roll them in parchment paper and freeze it, and have them anytime you want :D"}

Cut the half onion sideways as thinly as yo can, place half the butter in a skillet and tun on the fire on the lowest setting, add the onion and toss it for a minute, until is strts to wither.\n\r\n2. Add the rice and, stirring delicately, toast it until it becomes tramnslucent and starts making a thn sound, almost a whistle. This is defined as the \"singing\" rice. This part is essential because the toasting is infact a light parboiling of the rice, which  allows it to cook more uniformously.\n\r\n3. Add the wine, stir once so that the wine reaches the bottom of the pan and let the rice rest for a couple of minutes, until the wine starts to smell differently, sweeter. Don't start adding other liquids until the wine has changed smell, or the risotto will turn out sour.\n\r\n4. Now add enough stock to completley cover the rice (you will have leftover stock!), stir just once or, better, shake the skillet so that the liquid reaches the bottom of the pan. Do not stir the rice in this phase of the preparation. Stirring ruins the very ligh parboiling obtained with the toasting, making the rice cook much faster outisde than inside, and causes the rice to leak the starch that results in the rice sticking to the pan. Adding the stock in bulk in one or two additions, not allowing it to dry out, and not stirring will leave the rice grains intact, perfectly cooked inside and outside, and tastier. And you will have time to fix the table or a salad while you don't have to stir the rice.\n\r\n5. When the rice is extremely \"al dente\" and  \"all'onda\" you are ready for the last phase of the preparation. \"All'onda\" means wavy (see pic): on shaking the skillet the rice must move fluidly from side to side, creating waves, but no liquid should be visible. This is the mment to add the rest of the butter and the cheese and stir vigorously for a couple of minutes off the direct heat. This will finally release the starch (this is the moment when you need to release the starch) that, combining with the wetness and the fats in butter and rice will make the risotto creamy while the grains are still al dente and in a good shape.\n\r\n6.

Remove the skin and fat from the chicken breast.  From the centre of the breast cut down halfway on the long axis and then across to the right and to the left inside the meat.  Fold out the flaps and that should leave you with a flattened chicken breast.  Diagonally cut the meat into long, thin strips and transfer them to a bowl.  Add salt and nihonshu and leave to marinade while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.\n\r\n2.  Take about 10 aojiso leaves per breast and cut them through along the long axis.  Lay the halves on top of each other and roll them up.  Now very finely julienne the leaves so you are left with fine threads of the shiso.  Put them in a bowl and mix in a roughly equal amount of the ito-tougarashi.\n\r\n3.  In yet another bowl, add in an egg white (1-2 per breast also) and beat until slightly frothy.\n\r\n4.  Heat some frying oil in a wok or deep fryer to around 150-160C (at that temperature, small bubbles (but no big ones) should rise from the ends of a pair of wooden chopsticks as soon as you dip them in).  You don't want the oil too hot because you are not trying to brown the meat.  \n\r\n5.  Pour off any excess nihonshu from the chicken and add in a couple of tablespoons of cornflour. Mix thoroughly (using a pair of chopsticks is easiest from here on in) and then transfer first to the egg white and then to the shredded shiso and tougarashi.  Mix well and then start adding the chicken to the oil.  You'll want work quickly and to do this one piece at a time, or else you will be left with either a stuck together mass of chicken or burnt parts. \n\r\n6.  The chicken should only take 45 seconds or so.  The chicken should still be mostly white and the shiso and tougarashi crispy but not discoloured.  The fast cooking time and egg white make for a very soft and tender chicken (unlike many fried chicken dishes), which contrasts brilliantly with the crisp coating.  Drain on some paper and make the dipping sauce.\n\r\n7.  The dipping sauce couldn't be easier.  Assuming you're using a good-quality prepared tentsuyu (although it is incredibly easy to make from scratch also) you just put that in a bowl and add in your cranberry juice to taste.

Ramsay gave instructions on how to cook chicken breast - a nortoriously difficult part of the chicken to cook, seeing as how it has a tendency to dry out. The way he overcame this was by poaching the chicken first, before frying it to finish the cooking and to give it that beautiful, golden, crisp exterior, while keeping the inside really juicy and moist.

Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the cream to create an airtight seal and refrigerate until cold or, if you want to cool it quickly put the bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice cubes and cold water and stir the pastry cream occasionally until it is thoroughly chilled, about 20 minutes.\r\n   6. The pastry cream can be kept, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n\r\nPeach Tart\n\r\n   1. Cut a small cross in the bottom of each peach with a knife.

So I kinda made this up to take the things I like about squash\u2014its starchy fluffiness, its rich orange flavour, the inescapable feeling of autumn\u2014and make a willows-style dessert out of them. Something that's not too demanding, but looks it.\r\n\r\nThis is just a recipe for the squash topping. Serve it warm on something cold and mild. I'd go with dulce de leche ice cream, or vanilla gelato, in the perfect case, but as pictured I'm using cappuccino ice cream, which as it turns out is fairly delicious.\r\n\r\nHypothetically, I think you could make this with less sweeteners, perhaps simply leaving the sugar out, and use bacon fat, for a savory version, served on maybe savory crepes with big crystals of salt?", "title": "Burnt Caramel Squash with Ice Cream", "ingredients": ["About a quarter of a kabocha squash (You could use another kind of squash but I can't imagine wanting to", "Pumpkin pie spice and some extra ginger (I actually used tea masala, it's pretty similar", "Honey (preferably dark and intense like buckwheat (I used this) or chestnut", "Sugar", "Apple cider vinegar", "Dark sesame oil (Asian style", "A neutral vegetable oil", "Pecans, crushed gently (biggish chunks", "Ice cream", "A pizza stone (optional"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/burnt-caramel-squash-with-ice-cream", "prep_time": "10 Min", "method": "1.

You want to be able to get a pecan piece, squash cube, and a bit of ice cream in each spoonful if you can.\n\r\n3. In a mixing bowl add the squash and say a half- to a whole teaspoon of spice mixture. About a tablespoon of honey, or just enough that you think it might coat the squash, and a splash of vinegar just enough to loosen the honey, just a few drops of sesame oil, and stir it all up so that the spices are evenly distributed and the squash is covered in the glaze.\n\r\n4. Line a 9\"x9\" baking pan with foil, going all the way up the sides so you make sort of a disposable pan out of tinfoil. Seriously do this. Burnt caramel is **not easy to clean.** Pour in the squash cubes and spread them out in a single layer, then drizzle with your neutral oil a little bit. You don't need a ton, just a tablespoon or so. Oven (on the stone if using) and bake for a while, stirring every 15 minutes or so.\n\r\n5. The glaze will begin to bubble and darken. While it's still quite liquid, take out the hot pan, stir, then spread out the squash again and sprinkle with sugar. You want to get a good sparkling layer of sugar going here, it'll take a handful or two. I estimate half a cup? Back in the oven to caramelise. Watch it carefully. Eventually the syrup will begin to harden and sizzle in the oil\u2014this is where it gets risky. By this time the squash will be a deep red or mahogany colour, and should be going translucent. When it's as dark as you dare, take it out of the oven and simply lift the foil lining out of the pan. Set this aside somewhere and put your pecans in the still-hot, empty baking pan (which you have towelled dry if any steam has condensed on it).\n\r\n6. Turn off the oven.\n\r\n7. Put the nuts in the oven (stone again) and just leave them there to toast in the residual heat until you can smell them. Then pour them over the cooling squash, put your pan liner thingy in the baking pan again for stability, and stir it all up. The remains of the caramel and oil should glaze the pecans nicely."}

On the cooking side, this means good, seasonal ingredients where the role of the chef is to bring out their natural characteristics and push them further through combinations of flavours, and on the eating side, it means food where people can come together and eat without pretension, but without sacrificing quality or experience.\n\nBasically, this is an interesting steamed vegetable dish to serve at a winter dinner party in place of ordinary vegetables or a salad.  The concept and service of the dish was intended to be both simple and spectacular at the same time. \n\nTo start, prepare the condiments.  \n\n**For the Jasmine Tea Salt**, grind a small amount of dry jasmine tea leaves and flowers in a mortar and pestle.  Then add in a very good quality mineral salt and combine with the pestle.  Done.\n\n**For the Spiced Mayonnaise**, take about 2 tablespoons of good quality prepared mayonnaise and mix through half a teaspoon of turmeric, and about a quarter teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, ground cumin and smoked paprika.  Set aside for at least half an hour for the colour and flavour to develop.\n\n**For the Black Butter**, first toast some black sesame seeds in a dry pan until fragrant.  Add 2/3 of the sesame seeds to a small food processor (reserving the rest for serving) and add in softened butter, Fortnam & Mason's Anchovy Alchemy (this is a delicious condiment, or substitute anchovy fillets to taste), capers, Caramel Sauce, a little garlic, a squeeze of lemon and lots of freshly ground black pepper.  Process until combined.\n\nThen it's time for the vegetables.\n\nAny winter vegetables will do, but I have used here (grouped in order of cooking time):   New Potatoes, Sweet Potato, Jerusalem Artichoke, (around 12 minutes) Baby Corn, Parsnip, Baby Carrot,  Baby Cabbage (I don't think I know what this is, it was like a Brussel Sprout but looked exactly like a tiny cabbage), Cauliflower (both white and purple), Broccoli, Romanesco (the extraordinary fractal shaped vegetable similar to broccoli that you can see hiding behind the carrot)(all around 5 minutes),  Goubo (burdock root),  Radish, Red Chicory, and Snow Peas (1-2 minutes).  Plus Ginko Nuts for presentation.\n\nOK, I probably went overboard with the selection here, but this is supposed to be a celebration of winter vegetables.  \n\nScrub them well but leave the skins on everything.  As a harvest dish the skins give the dish the earthy quality it needs.  I'm very fond of the Jerusalem Artichoke and Goubo for that  particular characteristic in this dish.  \n\nIf using the fresh Ginko Nuts like I did, you need to prepare this by cracking them out of their shells (the handle of the knife brought down on the seam of the nut will do this well, without squashing the nut).  Put the nuts in a bowl, pour over boiling water and sit for 10 minutes to loosen the inner skin.  Peel the nuts and then simmer in more water for 20-30 minutes to cook.  These are the only thing that was cooked separately.  The rest were done in the steamer.  And that's the fun part.\n\nCut all the vegetables to the size you like and lay them out on a cutting board in order of cooking time.  Set a countdown timer and add the vegetables in reverse cooking time order, so that they are all ready at the same time.  The vegetables should still be quite firm and \"al dente\".\n\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, plate up the condiments as shown in the picture.  As soon as the vegetables are done, arrange them in the steamer how you would like them to be presented and get them straight to the table.  Steamed vegetables go cold very quickly so I suggest improvising some kind of steam warmer for the table.  I did this with the antique wooden dish I bought at a market with a deep plate inside it filled with the steaming water, with the steamer placed on top of the whole thing.  \n\nThe dish itself looks quite spectacular when it's brought to the table, but it's not fussy or contrived at all.  When everyone just dives in with their hands and attacks the condiments on shared dishes, it's as casual an experience as you could ask for.  \n\nWhile of course any of the condiments can go with any of the vegetables, I was blown away by the combination of the parsnip with the Jasmine Tea Salt and the potatoes with the Black Butter.  The sweetness of the parsnip matched perfectly with the aroma of the jasmine, and the texture of the sesame and saltiness of the anchovy was amazing with the warm potato.\n\nGood food.  Good company.  Perfect."}

I made a little mixture with some rice vinegar, a pinch of sugar and some sesame oil to mix in to the rice. I'm not sure it was absolutely necessary, but I love sesame oil.\r\n3. Beat your eggs and cook into a little plain omlette in your pan. When done, slice into long strips.\r\n4. Slice your crabsticks into long thin slices, and your carrot, green onions and cucumer too. (Usually in kim bap there is a yellow pickled radish, but since I didn't have any I soaked the cucumber in rice vinegar for a short time). I cooked the carrot and green onions in a pan jsut a little to soften them up and bring a little flavour out.\r\n5. Spread a thin layer of rice on to the seaweed, taking care to leave a small gap at either end of the paper.\r\nArrange your ingredients on the rice together ready to be rolled up.\r\n6. It's probably better if you use a bamboo rolling mat for this, but I didn't have one and it worked out okay - roll quite tightly making sure not to let any of it leak out or get messy. Seal it with a little water/rice at the end.\r\n7. Slice in to about 8-10 portions.\r\n8. Serve!"}

Rinse the cabbages, then quarter them lengthwise, discard the stems, and then chop the cabbages laterally, which should leave you with the largest pieces measuring perhaps 5 cm on a side.\r\n2.   Place the cabbage in a clean plastic bag or equivalent (with no holes) and sprinkle salt over each layer. The best kind of salt is sea salt, although non-iodized table salt will do. This will create a brine solution with the cabbage juice.  Press the leaves in your hand to squeeze as much water out of them as possible. Once finished, tie up the bag and set it aside for 5-6 hours.\r\n3.  Take the cabbage out of the salt solution and rinse it if necessary. It should be a lot softer than it was. Again, remove surplus water. Place cabbage in a sealable plastic box. Add the spring onions, chopped into small pieces. Crush the garlic and ginger in a press and mix in. You may also add half an onion,\r\n4.  Add the chili powder. Unsurprisingly, the best chili powder for kim chi can be found at a Korean grocery store, which has a bright red color. It is possible to use other kinds of chili powder, or pur\u00e9ed or thinly sliced chili peppers if this is unavailable. If you use hot chili powder, you might want to reduce the amount. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar.  Mash the chili powder into the leaves as you did in much the same way with the salt. If the color doesn\u2019t seem dark enough, add more chili powder. It\u2019s a good idea to wear gloves while doing this.\r\n5.  Put the containers aside for three or four days in a cool location. No snacking. After that, store it in the refrigerator."}

Rinse the chicken, then dry it very well with paper towels, inside and out. The less it steams, the drier the heat, the better.\n\r\nSalt and pepper the cavity, then truss the bird. Trussing is not difficult, and if you roast chicken often, it's a good technique to feel comfortable with. When you truss a bird, the wings and legs stay close to the body; the ends of the drumsticks cover the top of the breast and keep it from drying out. Trussing helps the chicken to cook evenly, and it also makes for a more beautiful roasted bird.\n\r\nNow, salt the chicken\u2014 I like to rain the salt over the bird so that it has a nice uniform coating that will result in a crisp, salty, flavorful skin (about 1 tablespoon). When it's cooked, you should still be able to make out the salt baked onto the crisp skin. Season to taste with pepper.

Separate the middle wing joint and eat that immediately. Remove the legs and thighs. I like to take off the backbone and eat one of the oysters, the two succulent morsels of meat embedded here, and give the other to the person I'm cooking with. But I take the chicken butt for myself. I could never understand why my brothers always fought over that triangular tip \u2014 until one day I got the crispy, juicy fat myself. These are the cook's rewards. Cut the breast down the middle and serve it on the bone, with one wing joint still attached to each. The preparation is not meant to be superelegant. Slather the meat with fresh butter. Serve with mustard on the side (Which I don't feel necessary as the chicken turned out to be quite flavorful) and, if you wish, a simple green salad.

{"cook_time": "60 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "Everything to do with how good your food tastes depends on the quality of everything that you put into it. Stocks are one of the most basic building blocks, so I figured it made sense to put some of my favourites here, i.e. chicken stock, vegetable stock and prawn stock. All of these stocks require such different treatment, which is why I've chosen them. For example, the chicken takes a couple of hours of cooking for all the flavour to fully be extracted, whereas the prawns take slightly less, and the flavour of the vegetable stock is actually detracted from if you cook it too long.\r\n\r\nChicken stock is a great meat-based stock that is really light in flavour, and is great as a braising liquid as it readily takes on the flavours of the ingredients cooked in it. Vegetable stock is a great all-purpose liquid for cooking (from making sauces to deglazing pans to hydrating pasta, to making any number of soups), so I always have a bottle handy in my fridge (and another in my freezer for when the one in my fridge runs out). Prawn stock is a little more specialised, but I love making prawn noodle soup (where use the diluted prawn stock to simmer pork soup bones before cooking egg noodles and fresh prawns in them), or even using it to add an extra kick to prawn pastas.\r\n\r\nI add chicken feet to my chicken stock as there is a tonne of collagen in the feet, which gives the stock a gelatinous quality without having to reduce it. If you can't find them, then just go without. The other favourite of mine is veal stock, but I think that really deserves a post on its own, so when I make a new batch of that, I'll give you guys a heads up. :)", "title": "Stocks", "ingredients": ["Chicken Stock", "2 kg chicken necks, backs, wings and bones", "500g chicken feet", "2 large carrots", "2 large leeks (white and light green parts only", "2 large brown onions", "1 bay leaf", "1 tbsp white peppercorns", "1 big bowl of ice cubes", "Prawn Stock", "1 kg prawn heads and shells", "2 large brown onions, peeled and cut into 1cm", "mirepoix", "1 small carrot, peeled and cut into 1cm", "mirepoix", "olive oil", "Vegetable Stock", "3 large carrots, peeled", "4 large brown onions, peeled", "4 large leeks, white and light green parts only", "1 head of fennel", "2 parsnips, peeled", "1 tbsp olive oil", "1 bay leaf", "mixture of fresh herbs (I like using either tarragon or thyme, or you can omit this completely"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/stocks", "prep_time": "25 Min", "method": "Chicken Stock\r\nRinse the chicken bones and feet well to remove any visible blood and any internal organs still attached. Blood proteins coagulate when heated and this will cause your stock to become cloudy. Cut the bones into 3-inch pieces.\r\nPlace the bones in a large stock pot, and fill with enough cold water to cover the bones by about 2 inches. Place over low heat, and bring to the boil slowly. It normally takes about an hour for my stock to come to a boil, so give it time. If you try to heat it too vigourously, it will end up emulsifying the impurities into the soup. Heat it gently, and skim constantly.\r\nWhile waiting for the soup to come to a boil, peel and chop the vegetables into 1-inch mirepoix. A stock is not a rubbish bin that you dump odds and ends into, so peel your carrots. That's right. PEEL THEM.\r\nOnce the liquid starts to come to a simmer, do as much straining as you can. This is when some of the impurities start to get dislodged, so really get all that gunk out. After about 5 minutes of heavy-duty skimming, add in the ice cubes and skim out the fat that coagulates on the surface. I must stress again that you should skim as much as possible, because once you add the aromatics and vegetables in, it'll be a lot harder to.\r\nAdd the vegetables and aromatics in, and bring the stock back to a simmer. Let it simmer gently, skimming where possible (I usually give up after this), for another hour. Turn off the heat, then let it rest for 15 minutes, as this will allow the particles to settle at the bottom of the pot.\r\nLine a fine grained sieve with muslin, and set it over another medium-sized pot, which you then place in an ice bath. Ladle the stock out through the sieve into the pot. Do NOT pour the stock out, as this will force the impurities through, and do not press down on the residue that collects in the muslin. Allow the stock to cool in the ice bath until it reaches room temperature, then cover, label, and refrigerate overnight. The layer of fat which has solidified on the top can now be removed easily.\r\nIf using within 3 days, store in an airtight container in the fridge. Otherwise, either freeze as is, or reduce to 1/4 the volume and freeze in ice cube trays, rehydrating with 3x the volume of each cube of water when thawing to save space.\n\n\r\nPrawn Stock\r\nPlace the onions and carrots with 1 tbsp of olive oil in a medium-sized pot. Saut\u00e9 over gentle heat until the onions are translucent (don't let them colour) and the carrots are slightly softened. Remove from heat and set aside.\r\nIn a hot saut\u00e9 pan, saut\u00e9 the prawn heads and shells (in batches if necessary) in olive oil until bright orange and cooked through. They should be really fragrant. Add the cooked heads and shells into the pot with the onions and carrots. Repeat until all the shells are cooked.\r\nAdd enough cold water to cover the heads and shells by about 1cm, and place over low heat. Slowly bring it to a simmer, skimming off the impurities and foam that rise to the top, and allow to simmer for 45min. The stock should have taken on the colour of the shells.\r\nRemove from the heat, and pour everything (in batches, if necessary), into a blender. Process, then strain into a metal bowl or container set in an ice bath, pressing down on the shells with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all the juices. Allow to cool completely, then cover and refrigerate for 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month.\n\n\r\nVegetable Stock\r\nFinely chop all the vegetables (you can use a food processor if possible). Fry it in olive oil in a stock pot on low heat until the vegetables are all softened and fragrant, but have not coloured (5 minutes or so). Add in the bay leaf and whatever fresh herbs if you're using any, then fill the stockpot with cold water (enough to cover the vegetables by 2 inches).\r\nSlowly bring it to a simmer, then simmer for 35 minutes, skimming any impurities off the surface. When the cooking time is up, remove from the heat and let it stand for 15 minutes to allow the particles to settle.\r\nLine a fine grained sieve with muslin and set it over another pot which has been placed in an ice bath. Ladle the stock through the sieve, allow to cool completely, then refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months. (This stock can also be reduced further and frozen as ice cubes.)"}

Remove about two tablespoons of the flour mixture and reserve.  Whisk in the beer until you get a thick batter consistency.

Peel your prawns, leaving the tails intact (if using) and skin and dry your fish).  I cut some deep diagonal cuts in the legs side of the prawns because I didn't want them to curl too much when frying. The prep is done so wash up and get ready to deep fry.\n\r\n5.  Heat your oil to around medium high.  You don't want it too hot or everything will brown before it is cooked.\n\r\n6.

For when the gyoza are done.\n\r\n1. Put your pomegranate seeds into a blender and strain the juice into a bowl.  \n\r\n2. Mix in a dash of lemon juice, a touch of sesame oil and a drizzle of chilli oil.  Taste it - it should be quite tart, with a little sweetness.  Some chopped coriander or mint would also be great in this, I think.\n\r\n**The Gyoza**\n\r\nThe only difficult thing about making gyoza is the actual wrapping of the skins.  For that, rather than try to cumbersomely describe the process in words, I made a video which is linked below.\n\r\n1. Roughly chop your shrimp and add to a big mixing bowl.  Finely chop the chives and throw them in.  Mince some garlic and ginger - only a small amount is required, really the gyoza should taste of shrimp and chive, not of garlic - and add it to the bowl.  Add a touch of sesame oil, about the same amount of rice wine and a tiny grinding of salt.  Mix thoroughly and add an egg white to bind.\n\r\n2. Grab your gyoza skins and make gyoza!  To see how this is done, please watch my Youtube video on [How To Make Gyoza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spsGbDWauf4) :)\n\r\n3. As I mention in the video, keep your gyoza somewhere cool before you cook them.  Ideally, put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes beforehand.  This will help the skins to stiffen so they don't become inflated, gelatinous blobs during cooking.\n\r\n**Cooking The Gyoza**\n\r\nEveryone has a different method for cooking gyoza - fry first boil last, boil first fry last yadda yadda - here is my method which is a foolproof way of getting satisfyingly crispy bottoms as well as pleasantly steamed tops.  It's a boil first first fry last method.\n\r\n1.  Heat about a centimeter of water in a flat-bottomed wok (or any pan you have with a lid).\n\r\n2. When the water is at a rolling boil, gently lay your gyoza in rows.  Laying them in rows makes it easier to remove them later (just scoop them up in rows).  Cover, allowing space for escaping steam, and let boil for a few minutes.\n\r\n3. Uncover.  There will still be some water left at this point.  Let it all boil down and watch the pan carefully.  When it begins to go all frothy and dry, add some oil to the pan (there may still be a tiny bit of water in the pan but that's ok).  Tilt the pan so that the oil covers all edges of the gyoza.  It's safe to tilt the pan as the gyoza will most likely be stuck completely to it.\n\r\n4. Let the gyoza fry for 4 -5 minutes on a medium heat.  Absolutely do not touch the gyoza at all - they will not be ready to be released from the pan until the very end of the cooking process.  You will need use your spidey sense a bit and carefully watch the bottom fringes of your gyoza to give you an idea of how brown the undersides are - careful not to burn them.\n\r\n5. When you think the bottoms have browned enough, turn off the heat.  Grab a flat spatula and scoop the gyoza up off the pan in rows.  Eat them fresh from the pan, dipped in the ponzu, all crispy and succulent :)"}

There also appears to be a bit of an absence of many barbeque recipes on the site. Since I'm currently living in Fiji, I'm constantly faced with two recurring usuals. One is general unavailability of special ingredients which means we have to be creative with what we have, the other is a need to cook outside.Miko's my youngest daughter, born here in Fiji. I made this chicken dish at her first ever BBQ, hence the name. Goes well with Fiji Bitter beer."}

Cut the crusts off your bread and use a mug to press a hole in the center.  Yes, we're about to make \"egg in bread\".\n\r\n2. Put your baked beans on a low heat and stir occasionally.\n\r\n3. Add a glug of olive oil and a knob of butter to a griddle pan.  When hot, gently lay your slice of bread in and let it fry for a minute until golden on the underside.  Flip it over, bring the heat down and crack an egg into the hole.\n\r\n4. Chuck a few mushrooms in the pan and squeeze a bit of lemon on them.  Let everything cook through (don't turn the egg-bread, just let it cook from underneath).\n\r\n5. Garnish with something green - a rosemary sprig or a fried sage leaf would do nicely.  Season your egg with a bit of freshly ground salt and pepper."}
