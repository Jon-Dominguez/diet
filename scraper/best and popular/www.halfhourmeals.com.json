I used about a 2 thirds of the tub of yogurt. Put the yogurt into a bowl and add the garlic. Drain the juices from the passionfruit through a fine sieve and add the juice to the yogurt, no pits please. Lastly a good pinch of salt, a good grind of pepper and mix well. Your done. \n\r\nLastly give your rice a good stir and add salt & pepper to taste, then stir through the macadamia nuts. By now your chicken fillets should be cooked through. To assemble, place a good mound of rice in the centre of the plate, top with 2 cooked chicken fillets and dollop with the passionfruit yogurt sauce."}

Preheat the oven to 400F and put some parchment paper or tinfoil on a baking sheet and spray or grease with olive oil. Rinse the salt off the eggplant and pat dry. Organize your breading station by having (from left to right): eggplant, flour mixture, wet ingredients bowl, prepped baking sheet.  Have wet and dry dishtowels on hand - this gets messy.\n\r\n5. Dredge an eggplant slice through the flour on both sides. Dip into the wet mix. Shake. Dredge through flour again on both sides. Dip into the wet mix. Shake.

I found it helpful to put half the flour mixture in a different bowl and then swap halfway. As the flour mixture gets a bit wet, it gets harder to bread the eggplant evenly.\n\r\n6. Bake at 400F for about 20 minutes, flipping the slices halfway. They\u2019re done when golden and crispy looking. I put them under the broiler for a minute or two to really get them crisp. \n\r\n7.

Soak your beans - Take some black-eye beans, the amount will depend on how much you want to make. Cover in cold water and soak overnight. The next day, take some time out and use your fingers to rub and remove all the skins. The skin won't make it inedible or anything... however, it will look more attractive without the skin. \n\r\n2. Boil Your Beans - Take your beans and cover in water, and simmer until soft. \n\r\n3. Mash your beans - Once soft, you can drain the water, and mash up the beans. This can be done using a potato masher, blender or some other mashing utensil. My gran uses a chinese soup spoon.\n\r\n4. Fry the beans and make the filling - Dry-fry the mashed beans in a non-stick pan. Make sure that the pan is bone dry and no oil is used. This is to dehydrate the beans so that you're not left with a mushy wet slop that would be difficult to handle and not taste so good. After about 10 minutes or so, you and add other filling ingredients to enhance the flavour and continue frying with added oil. \n\r\n5. Make your dough - This recipe calls for glutinous rice flour. We used the whole packet, but kept a little to the side to keep the fingers dry and non-sticky when it comes to making the separate doughy balls. So, for the moment, put around 4/5 of the packet into a big bowl. Gradually add hot (not boiling) water to the flour, mixing and kneading as you go until the flour becomes a soft doughy mixture. Not too dry, not too wet. Sorry, no measurements here. \n\r\n6. Making the ?? - filling your pastry with the filling. Cover your hands in flour, tear out a walnut sized piece of dough. Knead and roll in your hands until the dough becomes a smooth ball shape. Dip the ball in the flour to give a light coating of flour. Push a finder into the dough, making a hole, take a pinch of flour and place inside the hole. Stick the thumb of your right hand inside the hole. Using the other fingers, turn and squeeze the dough, stretching it up and out. Your left hand should be used for support. You should end up with a fairly large cup, ensure that you fix any holes. This is the point where you find out whether you got your dough consistency correct. Too little water and the dough won't be pliable, too much water and it will be sloppy and sticky, and you'll have holes all over the place. Fill the cup with your filling about 1 tablespoon full.  Take the mouth of the cup and turn whilst you squeeze and pleat, making the mouth smaller and smaller until you can twist the edges together. Tear off the little nub that's left at the end. Pat and Smooth the dough all over \n\r\n7. Soak your Bamboo Leaves - Bamboo leaves are used as the lining for your caa4 gwo2 to sit on. Once steamed, the dough becomes incredibly sticky and gooey. Without the bamboo leaves, you simply wouldn't be able to remove the ?? from the plate. These can be soaked whilst you were making your ??... so this should probably be step No 6. \n\r\n8. Cut your bamboo leaves into squares\r\nMake sure they're large enough to fit your ?? with a bit of extra space for the ?? to spread. \n\r\n9. Plop your ?? on top of the leaves \n\r\n10. Steam your ?? - Place the ?? on a plate or a wire rack and place inside a steamer. We used a wok full of boiling water with a high domed lid. In the water, we have a metal stand so that the dish with the caa gwo are high above the water. They don't need to be steamed for long, about 10 minutes should do. Gran says that you shouldn't overcook them or they become sloppy, likewise, you shouldn't undercook them or they're not pliable and squishy enough. \n\r\n11. Grease up your ?? - Once your ?? are done, take them out of the steamer, and start spreading cold vegetable/sunflower oil over the surface of the caa gwo. This is to give them a lovely sheen, and to stop them from sticking to eachother. \n\r\n12. Eat your lovely ?? - Best eaten practically straight out of the steamer. Be careful not to burn yourself. It's wonderful when warm, squishy and pliable. Once cooled, it hardens and becomes horrible and chewy. If you have to keep them for a day or so, wrap them up in plastic to prevent dehydration. Upon eating, they can be revitalised by sprinkling some water on them and microwaving for a bit."}

{"cook_time": "10 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "There's something just that much more luxurious about freshly home-made pasta, and for some reason most of the fresh pasta recipes I've found and tried all make ginormous amounts of pasta. I finally found one that I could tweak for two people with good appetites to have for a simple dinner at home (or you could probably feed 3 or 4 as part of a 4-or-more course dinner). This is just a simple recipe for plain egg pasta. It works well for noodley pasta like tagliatelle (which I tried to make here, but ended up with something between tagliatelle and parpadelle), as well as ravioli. I think most people don't realise how dead simple it is to make your own pasta. Definitely try this one, and you'll be hooked - I promise!\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, plenty of other ways to make pasta: including using different types of flour such as semolina, or different types of liquid like water, egg yolks only, or a mixture of the three. Then there's adding things like spinach, squid ink, herbs and the suchlike for flavourings and colouring. Start off with something simple like this, then you can start experimenting to see which type you like most.\r\n\r\nNote: for ravioli, the sheets of pasta should be almost translucent, I've rolled these sheets a fair bit thicker than that.", "title": "Fresh Egg Pasta", "ingredients": ["- 150g italian type '00' flour, sifted (or an all-purpose flour with about 10% protein content, double sifted)", "- 2 whole eggs, beaten", "- a pinch of salt", "- extra flour for dusting"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/fresh-egg-pasta", "prep_time": "30 Min", "method": "1. Sift your flour into a mound on your work table, make a well in the middle.\n\r\n2. Stir the salt into the beaten eggs, and pour it into the well.\n\r\n3. Starting from the centre, and using a fork (or your fingers if you wish), mix it in a circular motion, incorporating a bit more of the flour at a time as you go along, until the mixture is no longer squishy, then you can chuck the fork in the sink, roll up your sleeves, and knead it around a bit until it gets a bit of an elastic feel and a nice sheen.\n\r\n4. Wrap it tightly in clingwrap and set it aside for at least 15 minutes (preferably 30 or more) to rest. This will help to make it a lot more manageable when you're rolling it out. If you're going to be rolling by hand, you might want to let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour to an hour and a half.\n\r\n5. Divide the dough into two, and roll it into 2 rough balls, then flatten one into a rectangular piece and keep the other under a damp tea towel. Run it through the widest setting of your pasta roller twice, then fold it over and run it through again. Repeat this 2 or 3 times.\n\r\n6. Crank the setting down and slowly get it to the thinness you require, then you're ready to cut it up and/or fill it, and cook it!\n\r\nKeep in mind that fresh pasta takes a lot less time to cook than dried pasta. This lot only took about 3 minutes to get to al dente and was divinely silky on the outside, soaked up all the flavour from the sauce, and still had a good bite left to it."}

And now, the student has become: THE TEACHER. The tortilla is one of those cultural standards that everyone has SECRET ingredients for; I've heard it's better if you whip the eggs with whole milk, or put in fried chorizo, or add pureed bat's wings collected at midnight of a full moon. This is just the way I learned, and the way I like it best, but it's very versatile and fun to play with additions. Ol\u00e9!", "title": "Tortilla de Dspa\u00f1a de Deliciousa", "ingredients": ["- 6 potatoes, peeled and rinsed", "- 4-5 large eggs", "- 1 large white onion", "- about 1 cup extra virgin olive oil (some people have slight heart attacks when they see the amount of oil required, but big oily is key)", "- salt", "- pepper"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/tortilla-de-espaa-de-deliciousa", "prep_time": "15 Min", "method": "1. Cut the potatoes laterally, then into half-moon slices, each about half an inch thick\n\r\n2. pour the gadzillion gallons of oil into a 9-inch-ish frying pan, and turn heat on high a few minutes, till the oil is very hot, but not smoking.\n\r\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan (do this very carefully, because the oil is at a prime disfiguring-skin-burn heat level). Stir it up a bit, so the oil has coated all the potatoes and they are spread out to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally to keep them from burning, then add the onions. Mix onions in with the potatoes, again stirring sporadically to ward off Mr. Burny, but not too much.\n\r\n4. When the potatoes are golden and a little squishy (about ten more minutes), take pan off the heat. Use a slotted spoon to move the mix into a large bowl, and pour the leftover oil into a separate container (you'll need it again) and wipe down the pan.\n\r\n5. While the potato/onions cool a bit, start on the eggs. For a fluffy texture, I like to separate the yolk and white. Use a fork and viciously stir the whites till they're nice and frothy (about the consistency of a rabid dog's mouth foam, but not quite as thick as a rabid raccoon's). \n\r\n6. After letting the po-nion mix cool about five minutes, toss in the yolks. DON'T OVERMIX IT, just give it a few swipes to coat around, then add the whites and do the same. Give it ten minutes to absorb the eggs. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\r\n7. put about a tablespoon or two of the saved oil in the pan. Heat it up about a minute (again, simmery, not smokey), then pour in the egg-tater-onion mix, spreading it to cover the pan bottom. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook about ten minutes. Don't stir, but do shake the pan every once in a while, to make sure it doesn't stick. the surface shouldn't cook through, but it should get a bit less runny.\n\r\n8. This part is kind of tricky, but don't be scared. Take a big plate or the lid of the frying pan and place it over the mix. Grab the pan handle, and turn the whole thing upside down so the uncooked portion of the tortilla will be face down on the plate. This is best done whilst over the sink or a bowl to catch drippings and/or crashings down in failure. \n\r\n9. Now the soon-to-be-perfect-tortilla is cooked-side facing up! Magic! add another spoon or two of oil to the pan, then slide the uncooked-tortilla-side on down. This will only need to cook about two minutes. I like it kind of runny inside; if you want the mixture firmer, cook it longer, and stick a toothpick into the center to gauge done-ness. You can also flip it a few more times, to your heart\u2019s desire. Use a spatula to kind of mold the edges if you want them pretty.\n\r\n10. Eat. Love. I think it's tastiest about room temp, usually with some salt, and maybe tomato and mozzarella salad. Makes an excellent hangover food."}

Prep the dough (typically the day beforehand): mix the dry ingredients (except for the powdered sugar) in a big metal bowl, then add the wet ingredients, including the yeast and butter.  (Addition of wheat gluten will make the fritters more airy but a little tougher -- it's your choice to do this or not)  Mix to combine into a dough, cover with a clean towel, and either rise for an hour at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge.\n\r\nWhen you are ready to eat the fritters, get out the flour and sprinkle it over the surface (use a cutting board or a big piece of wax paper, don't use your countertop), wet your hands, and coat them with flour too.  Gather up the dough in the bowl and put it on the floured surface you just prepared. \n\r\nKnead the dough a couple times (not too much or you will make it too tough), then roll it out about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick.  If you do not own a rolling pin, a wine bottle dusted in flour is fine.  Cut some squares 2-3 inches a side (or triangles 3+ inches a side) and set to rest (final rising stage).\n\r\nMeanwhile, heat a quart or more of oil to 365-375 degrees (a candy thermometer is cheap and useful for this purpose).  The more oil you use, the less it will cool off when you add each fritter, but the more it will cost.  I use a 1.5qt pot and fry them one at a time.    If you own a fryer, set it for 375 degrees.  Get a cooling rack (or steal one from your toaster oven, bbq grill, or screen door) and put paper towels underneath it for draining.\n\r\nAfter about 10 minutes, the oil should be up to temperature and the pieces of dough should have risen noticeably.  Use a slotted spoon to put each one into the frying oil -- if you are using a small pot, you'll fry them one at a time.  After about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or once the fritter has puffed up and turned golden brown, flip it over and fry the other side (another 1 to 2 minutes).  Remove with the slotted spoon and drain on the cooling rack, so that any excess oil drips onto the paper towels underneath.\n\r\nSprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve immediately.  Traditionally served with hot cafe au lait (scalded milk + pot-extracted coffee and chicory), the fritters are also tasty with berry preserves or syrup."}

Start with the butter:  Place butter in room temperature until you can knead it gently into a rectangular shape (~A4) over a piece of parchment paper (double size of an A4).  Place the butter in between the paper and refrigerate it until it's semi-hard. \n\r\n2.  The Dough:  Microwave the milk to lurk warm (over done it will kill the yeast), sprinkle and stir in the yeast then combine with sugar, eggs, oil, flour and salt. Knead lightly and adjust the softness with flour. Let it rest for an hour until double in size (1 - 1.5 hours), then punch it and put it back to the fridge (30 mins).  Roll the dough into double-A4 size and place the butter on either side and seal the dough.  You want to wrap the butter block with the dough evenly.  Try stretching the dough evenly and be careful not to break it.  \n\n\r\n3.  Folding the Dough:  Roll out the now A4 dough, when it's thin enough (1 cm), fold them into three fold  (like how you fold banknotes into Lei See Packet.  Well if you're Western - like folding Business letter).  Remember to dust the working space with flour or it'd stick and you will want to die.  Roll it flat again until 1 cm thin, and fold it again.\n\r\n4.  Chill the Dough:  Now retrain yourself and stop folding (I know it's fun) - It's very important to tuck the dough back to the fridge (wrap in parchment paper to prevent drying).  If you don't and keep on folding it, the butter melts and the croissant will not come out fluffy.\n\r\n5.  Repeat steps 3-4 one - two more times and 30 mins chilling in between.  Cover in foil and chill over night.  The dough will grow a bit so don't wrap it too tight.\n\r\n6. Shaping the Croissant:  Roll the dough, and cut it in half for easier handling, and roll it to a scandalous 3 mm thin.  Shape it into tissue paper size, and cut it diagonally.  with the tip facing against you, roll the the triangle upwards.  \n\r\n7.  Mine turned out to be phallic because I didn't secure the middle tip under the croissant when I baked it.  If you want a decent croissant, seal the middle tip under when tuck in the oven :)\n\r\n8.  Beat the egg, and brush it over the croissants.  Cover with parchment paper and let it rest for an hour (don't skip this step, because the yeast will create air during the rest, making the croissant fluffy).  Preheat the over with a 100C, tuck the croissant in, and turn up to 130C, for about 15-20 mins.\n\r\n9.  Now brew your coffee\n\r\n10.  Think of what you are going to be in a year time.\n\r\n11.

Cut the half onion sideways as thinly as yo can, place half the butter in a skillet and tun on the fire on the lowest setting, add the onion and toss it for a minute, until is strts to wither.\n\r\n2. Add the rice and, stirring delicately, toast it until it becomes tramnslucent and starts making a thn sound, almost a whistle. This is defined as the \"singing\" rice. This part is essential because the toasting is infact a light parboiling of the rice, which  allows it to cook more uniformously.\n\r\n3. Add the wine, stir once so that the wine reaches the bottom of the pan and let the rice rest for a couple of minutes, until the wine starts to smell differently, sweeter. Don't start adding other liquids until the wine has changed smell, or the risotto will turn out sour.\n\r\n4. Now add enough stock to completley cover the rice (you will have leftover stock!), stir just once or, better, shake the skillet so that the liquid reaches the bottom of the pan. Do not stir the rice in this phase of the preparation. Stirring ruins the very ligh parboiling obtained with the toasting, making the rice cook much faster outisde than inside, and causes the rice to leak the starch that results in the rice sticking to the pan. Adding the stock in bulk in one or two additions, not allowing it to dry out, and not stirring will leave the rice grains intact, perfectly cooked inside and outside, and tastier. And you will have time to fix the table or a salad while you don't have to stir the rice.\n\r\n5. When the rice is extremely \"al dente\" and  \"all'onda\" you are ready for the last phase of the preparation. \"All'onda\" means wavy (see pic): on shaking the skillet the rice must move fluidly from side to side, creating waves, but no liquid should be visible. This is the mment to add the rest of the butter and the cheese and stir vigorously for a couple of minutes off the direct heat. This will finally release the starch (this is the moment when you need to release the starch) that, combining with the wetness and the fats in butter and rice will make the risotto creamy while the grains are still al dente and in a good shape.\n\r\n6. Serve immediately."}

Cool in the tins for 5 minutes before removing, or if you need to re-use the tray, cool in the tin for 2 minutes, then transfer them to another plate to cool. BE CAREFUL THEY MIGHT WARP.\r\n5. Combine the cream cheese, lemon juice, and capers. Cut the salmon slices into thirds and roll them over the tip of your index finger into rosettes.\r\n6. Top the frittatas with the cream cheese mixture, sprinkle some onion over, then top with a piece of smoked salmon. Garnish with finely choped chives.\n\r\n##Notes:\r\n- If you're attempting to work very quickly and try to save some cleanup, using mini muffin cups (like what I did here), try to use at least 2-3 layers, else they end up warping and becoming really, really ugly (I chucked out almost 10, 'cos I'm a presentation nazi). \r\n- If you use a wire rack to set them on after cooling in the pan, make sure the bars aren't too far apart or you'll also end up with indented bottoms. Otherwise, don't be a ninny (like me), and just use a plate.\r\n- Another thing to note is that if you're gonna be a presentation nazi, you might want to use a squeeze bottle or transfer the egg mixture to a (small) pouring jug. Eggy bits on the outside: not aesthetically pleasing, and a bitch to clean off.\r\n- I prefer using white pepper 'cos I don't like black specks in the eggs. However, you can also do variations on this and add herbs to the frittata - in which case add 2 tbsp of finely chopped herbs (e.g. dill, tarragon, chives would do nicely), and you can obviously use cracked black pepper here.\r\n- The cream cheese mixture, salmon rosettes, chopped onions, and chives can be prepared and set aside in the fridge in advance. (Cover the onions with clingfilm so you don't stink up the whole fridge.) Just store it all in the fridge. The frittatas can be done a couple of hours ahead of time, just store at room temperature, and pop back into the oven set at 120\u00b0C on a baking tray to warm through for 1-2 minutes. The final assembly just takes a few minutes, and can be done just before your guests arrive."}

Keep it moving around the pan to make sure you don't get chunks that are too big, or it'll be difficult to assemble your lasagne later on.

Of course, the age-old problem of living in Japan reared it\u2019s ugly head and I wasn\u2019t able to find lamb belly here.

Rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\r\nWhile the lamb is cooking you can make the salsa verde. Don't make this too far in advance - you need to serve the salsa verde within about half and hour of making it as the vinegar will \"cook\" the green out of the herbs and it won't look nice.  Just throw all the solid ingredients into a food processor in the proportions you like - I used a whole coriander plant (with root), a big handful of mint, 5 or 6 shiso leaves, 5 green chillies and two cloves of garlic.  Pulse it for a few seconds until finely chopped and then transfer out to a bowl.  I added about a teaspoon of fish sauce, a teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of yuzu kosho, about one and a half tablespoons of rice vinegar and a big squeeze of lemon juice.  Mix it all together and that\u2019s it.\n\r\nChop the ribs, dress with the sauce (or serve it separately) and enjoy.  I served this with rice separately and with more of the sauce on the side.\n\r\nA big difference between the sauce and a normal salsa verde (apart from ALL the ingredients, of course) is that it contains no oil.  The flavour is sweet and biting and is perfect for cutting through rich foods like roasted meats or fried fish.  I eat a variation of this (no mint) with Siew Yuk and it is perfect. \n\r\nI also like this sauce with roasted lamb flaps.  If you don\u2019t know about lamb flaps, they are the belly off-cuts from the end of the chop.  They\u2019re sinfully cheap and pornographically fatty.  A favourite in Fijian cooking, the import of lamb flaps has actually been banned in Fiji now in an effort to curb rampant obesity.  When a country bans importing a food for making everybody too fat you know you\u2019re in trouble.  But still, do yourself a favour.  Just once a year - no more - pick up some lamb flaps (around A$1 a kilo in Australia; never seen them in Japan) and slow roast them for a couple of hours in a low oven to render off most of the fat.  Make up a simple sauce of coriander, chili, vinegar and sugar, sit back, watch some football and enjoy one of the simplest, cheapest and yet most obscenely indulgent things you could ever eat.\n\r\nBut back to the recipe - yeah, try this out too.

If so, take it off the grill and serve; if not, put the lid back on and cook for a few minutes or keep the lid off to keep an eye on it. This is BBQing, not rocket science.\r\n5. Serve your pizza to amazed guests. You can BBQ anything! \n\r\nSome combinations to try:\r\n- Cheddar cheese, soy crumbles (or meat) and salsa for a Mexican-style pizza\r\n- Olive oil, goat cheese and basil for a fresh pizza\r\n- Mozzarella, tomato sauce, pineapple (and ham) for Hawaiian pizza\r\n- Anything you ever wanted to get on a pizza but were to afraid to ask for"}

Whisk the egg mixture (it would be prudent to use an electric one, unless you're feeling guilty about skipping this week's gym sessions) until the temperature registers 70\u00b0C on the thermometer.\r\n4. Replace the bowl in the standing mixer, and mix on medium-high speed (I used Speed 6 on my KitchenAid) for 5 minutes, or until cooled to room temperature.\r\n5. Reduce the speed to medium (Speed 4 on my KitchenAid), and - with the motor running - add in the butter one cube at a time.

Drop your coffee beans in, and give it a good stir to make sure each one is well coated.\r\n3. Pick the beans out of the chocolate, and let the excess chocolate drip off. I like using chopsticks to do this. Place them on a sheet of greaseproof paper to cool, and place them all in the fridge for about 30minutes or until set. Once its set, you can transfer them to a box (lined with grease proof paper), and keep tightly sealed in the fridge for quite long. No idea how long they last though - I always finish eating them within a couple of days. :)\n\r\nNote: If you're a neat freak, just use your fingers to mould the bottom of the beans so they're perfectly round. The heat from your fingers should make the chocolate pliable enough. After that, you can pop them back onto the greaseproof paper in the fridge and they'll solidify in a snap."}

Start by making mashed potato. This dish needs a more French-style mash (heavier, creamier, silkier) than an American-style mash (lighter, fluffier).  Take some waxy potatoes; peel and boil them in salted water until tender.  Water is the mortal enemy of mashed potato and will turn any mash into a stodgy gloop.  If you have asbestos hands, you can boil the potatoes with the skins on to reduce the amount of water that gets in but realistically, slipping the skins off a hot potato generally means sacrificing the tips of my wee fingers.  Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot they were cooked in.  The heat from the pot will drive off even more water and the edges of the potatoes will go a dry white colour.  Pass the potatoes through a mouli or ricer or just mash them (I prefer the ricer).  Then add in some cream, salt, pepper and butter and beat it all together with a wooden spoon until it is really creamy and smooth. To the cooked mash add about a quarter teaspoon of prepared wasabi per very heaped tablespoon of mash (or an equivalent portion of fresh grated wasabi). Don't add too much because you don't want it to be too pungent.  Keep this warm and covered and beat in some more cream if it dries out\n\r\n2.  Roll up the aojiso leaves and julienne (you need lots, but leave a few for serving).  \n\r\n3. Dust the scallops with seasoned flour and sear in a hot pan with some butter and olive oil.\n\r\n4.  Set another small pan over medium-high heat and add quite a lot of butter.  When foaming, add the shredded aojiso. The butter should brown ever so slightly, but you are not really trying to make a brown butter sauce.  Once the shiso crisps (but before it browns) remove from the heat and separate out the shiso from the butter.  To the butter, add a dash of soy and a squeeze of lemon juice.  Season if necessary.  Separating out the shiso before adding the soy lets the shiso retain its light green colour.  Otherwise, the soy will dye it a dark green.  \n\r\n5.  For presentation, lay a fresh shiso leaf on a plate or shallow dish and place a quenelle of wasabi mash on top of it.  Add the scallops, top with the crispy shiso and spoon over the butter sauce.\n\r\nThere's nothing particularly novel about wasabi mash, but it works well with this. I like this dish because the crispy shiso really adds something here. It keeps its minty, peppery flavour and the crispness really contrasts against the creamy mash, tender scallops and nutty butter."}

Wash, scrub and dry your lemons.  trim the ends, making a flat base at either end around the size of a small coin.\n\r\n2.  Quarter the lemons to within a half inch of the base, leaving them attached.  I also cut some of the lemons through into quarters so that they can take up the spaces in the jar that a whole lemon won't fit into.  I haven't noticed any difference in the taste or texture of the different cuts.  Leave some lemons aside and juice them.  You will need this juice to top up the jar to fully cover the lemons in the brine.\n\r\n3.  Sprinkle a handful of salt into the base of your jar and start adding the lemons.  tuff as much salt into the cavities of the attached lemons as the lemons will hold and press salt onto the flesh of the fully cut quarters.  As you add them to the jar, squash them down to release the juices.  Use the fully quartered lemons to take up any smaller spaces in the jar, adding more salt around the lemons as you add them.\n\r\n4.  When the jar is full, top with another handful of salt and add additional lemon juice to make sure that all the lemons are fully covered.  Leave an air space at the top of the jar.  Seal it up and leave out of the sun for at least 3 weeks before using.  They are better after a month or so and they apparently should keep out of the fridge for about 6 months.\n\r\nAs the lemons release their oils to the brine, it will take on a thick, sticky texture.  Some people report a lacy white film around the lemons.  I haven't noticed anything like that but it is apparently quite harmless and can simply be rinsed away.\n\r\nWhen ready the rind is soft and comes away from the flesh and pith very easily.  This is the part you're mainly after, although the flesh is quite tasty also and could be used for some purposes.  The pith isn't really good for anything. To use the lemons, just take them out of the jar with a non-reactive utensil and rise under cold water to wash away the brine. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh and pith.  \n\r\nPreserved lemons are a staple in North African cooking and are used in tagines and stews mainly, but stay tuned for some other recipes.  Think of them like brined olives, as they are similar in saltiness and texture.  \n\r\nI am seriously in love with these lemons at the moment.

When the mixture gets to a boil add in some more of the salt, pepper, cayenne, chili, and paprika, and cumin to it.

Also add in a few buillon cubes (or in lieu of the water add a few cups of stock/broth).\n\r\n3. Set the heat to low. Let it simmer for a few hours, stirring occasionally. After about an hour you can give it a taste to check what else it needs. It's not necessary, but I find a little blue cheese somtimes help give it a little kick if it doesn't taste quite the way you want. \n\r\n4. When you feel it's almost ready, add in the beans and a good bit of oregano and basil. Then let it simmer another 15-20 minutes or so before serving.\n\r\n5. Put some shredded cheese on top and serve with potato, rice, pasta, or as is. \n\r\nNotes: Slowly cooking it and letting it rest for time will help the flavors become intimate, but if you want it can be cooked quicker. Just skip adding water and cook at least an hour, give or take. \n\r\nAdding potato chunks into the chili also works great. It makes for a thicker chili and works well if you want to serve it as is."}

I woke up this morning with nothing to eat and I realised that I had leftover tartare sauce and a wok full of oil from the Fish & Chips I made yesterday.  I've always been a big fan of Chicken Nanban so I thought I'd give this a try.\r\n\r\nGoogle tells me that \"nanban\" translates to \"Southern Barbarian\" referring to the history of this dish, which was adapted from the Portuguese *escabeche* where fried fish were pickled in vinegar for sea voyages.  Early Portuguese sailors brought this to Japan and *nanban-zuke* is a fairly common method of preserving horse mackarel in the Miyazaki area.  The original Chicken Nanban was developed at the Ogura resturant in Miyazaki city in 1956 and consisted of fried chicken steeped in a rice vinegar solution.  This is one part of Japanese cuisine I don't really get - soaking deep fried things so that they become soggy.    To me, deep frying is all about the crispness so  I thought I would do this chicken dish a little differently.", "title": "The New Kurozu Nanban", "ingredients": ["**For the chicken...**", "Chicken Thigh Fillet (boneless and skinless, trimmed of visible fat - I don't think you need the skin for this recipe but you could keep it on if preferred)", "Nihonshu (sake)", "Chopped garlic or garlic powder", "White pepper", "Cornflour and Plain Flour", "**For The Glaze...**", "Black vinegar (any kind, I used the Chinese Chinkiang variety)", "Sugar (I used palm sugar but any kind will do I think)", "Soy sauce", "Plus tartare sauce to serve.

First marinade the chicken in some nihonshu (sake), some garlic powder and white pepper.  Leave in the marinade for around half an hour.\n\r\n2.  Sift together equal parts of cornflour and plain flour.  Season well with salt and white pepper.\n\r\n3.  To make the glaze, in a small saucepan add a few tablespoons of black vinegar, a tablespoon or so of soy and a tablespoon of sugar.  Add a dash of vegetable oil and little water and then bring to a simmer.  The glaze is done when it is glossy and slightly sticky.  Be careful not to burn it as once the sugar caramelises it will turn quickly.  Of course, as everything is black anyway you can't tell so you just have to estimate when to stop from the consistency and the aroma.\n\r\n4. While the glaze is simmering, heat your oil to around medium heat.  The chicken will take around 6-8 minutes to cook so keep the heat moderate so as not to over-brown the crust.\n\r\n5.  Dredge the chicken in flour and add to the hot oil.  The chicken is done when it floats and is a light golden colour, probably around 6 minutes or so if it's quite a thick thigh fillet.  Set aside the chicken to rest a few minutes.\n\r\n6.  To serve, drizzle the chicken with the hot glaze, slice and serve on a plate with plenty of tartare sauce."}

Still, a hot wok indoors works just fine.\n\r\nThis is a fairly dry noodle dish so I don't like to overload the wok.  Just making one or two servings at a time is best, and it's so quick that it doesn't really matter if you do one at a time.  This is especially good if you're eating with vegetarians or people with different tastes.  One person might want meat, one might want seafood and another might just want vegetables.

Peel and butterfly the prawns and cut the squid into rectangles.  Break up the noodles, using a little cold water if necessary.  Cut the lemon into wedges.

Add in a handful of noodles and then pour in a little chicken stock, some light soy, a teaspoon or so of chilli powder (to taste), a little salt and white pepper and then the dark soy sauce.  Don't add too much chicken stock, as this is supposed to be a dry dish and you really want the dry fried taste to it.  It shouldn't be too wet.  Fry it all together and then throw in another handful of beansprouts.  They only take a few seconds to cook and when they're done, so are you.\n\r\n5.

Remove the skin from the belly pork and separate the fat from the meat.  Cut the fat into lardons and chop the meat.  Marinade the chopped meat in a little chopped garlic, some white pepper, cornstarch, Maggi seasoning and sesame oil.  Render the lardons of fat over extremely low heat in a small frypan.  This will take about an hour and at the end of the process the liquid fat will be separated and you will be left with small crispy nuggets of pork fat (chu yau cha).  Pour of the fat and you're ready for frying.  (Of course, if you can buy solid pork fat separately you could use that for the chu yau cha and use another cut of pork for the meat in the dish.  I use belly pork simply because I can't buy the meat and fat separately.)\n\r\n2.  If you started with around 200 grams of pork belly (including fat and skin), that's enough for about two people.  While the fat is rendering, peel your prawns (around 3 or 4 each), cut the squid into rectangles and chop a bowl full of chinese cabbage crossways at around 1cm intervals.  Finely chop around 3 cloves of garlic.  Separate and soak your noodles in a large bowl full of cold water.  Your prep is done.  Tidy up and get your wok out, ready to fry.\n\r\n3.  Heat the reserved pork fat (the liquid, not the chu yau cha) in the wok until hot and add in the pork meat to brown.  When just browned throw in the prawns, squid and garlic.  After 30 seconds or so add in the Chinese cabbage and toss for another 30 seconds.  \n\r\n4.  Add in enough noodles for two people and pour over about half a cup of chicken stock.  Then add your seasonings: about a tablespoon of light soy sauce, a few healthy shakes of white pepper, about one and a half tablespoons of dark soy sauce (or more - the colour of the dish should be very dark) and a heaped teaspoon of sugar.  Toss in the wok and cook for a minute or two until the noodles are done.\n\r\n5.  To serve, make sure you get plenty of the thick, black gravy that has collected in the bottom of the wok in each serve.  The picture above doesn't quite do it justice, but trust me - there was a delicious thick black gravy around it.  Although it is a fried noodle dish, the gravy is very important.  Scatter the dish with crispy pork fat and serve with a spoonful of the sambal belcan and a wedge of lemon if you like.\n\r\n6.  Don't get any on your shirt."}

Finely chop about 3 shallots, red chilies to taste, a clove of garlic and grate about 2 teaspoons of ginger.  Heat some vegetable oil in a small saucepan and fry all of this off over medium heat.\n\r\n2.  When starting to brown add about two tablespoons of fish sauce, the juice of about half a lime, two tablespoons of palm sugar and about a tablespoon of the thick black caramel sauce for colour and sticky texture.  Add in the coconut (about 3 tablespoons - if you're using dessicated coconut you might need to add in a tablespoon or so of water to make sure it doesn't dry too much).  Mix and give it a minute or two to amalgamate.\n\r\n3.  Remove from heat and stir through some freshly chopped coriander and a tablespoon or so of the crushed roasted peanuts.  The coconut sambal is now finished and should be a sticky black consistency.  You can set this aside while you assemble the rest of the dish.\n\r\n4.  Season the prawns and toss in a little vegetable oil.  Sear on the grill until done.  You don't want the prawns to be too big because each parcel is best eaten as one big and gluttonous mouthful.  If the prawn is too big people won't get the whole thing in their mouths.\n\r\n5.  To plate, arrange your betel leaves on whatever plate or platter you like (It's impossible for me to get betel leaves in Japan so I've used shiso leaves here with very good results - it's convenient OK, I'm not addicted to shiso.  If you can't get either of those you could probably also substitute any edible fresh green leaf, e.g. large baby spinach leaves or something), top each leaf with a teaspoon or so of the sticky sambal and place a prawn on top of each leaf.  Squeeze over a few drops of fresh lime and from a squeeze bottle or off the end of a spoon drizzle over a touch more of the black caramel sauce, sprinkle with some additional crushed peanuts and a few reserved coriander leaves.  To eat, just wrap everything up in the leaf and stick it in your mouth.\n\r\n6.  Bask in the praise and adulation of your guests.\n\r\nI think this dish has a good balance of flavours, temperatures and textures that makes it quite unique.  The leaf is fresh, crisp and cool; the sambal is warm, spicy and sticky but with a slight crunch from the peanuts; and the grilled prawn is hot, firm and savoury.  I don't think there are too many dishes where you can have all that in one delicious mouthful."}

Dice the onions and finely chop the garlic.  Saute in a saucepan with some fresh marjoram until transparent.  Reserve half the onion and garlic in a separate bowl and add the can of tomatoes to the remaining onion in the saucepan.  Season with salt and pepper, add one teaspoon of tomato paste and simmer covered for half an hour.\n\r\n2.  To the reserved onion add in the meat, some finely chopped parsley, the breadcrumbs (just a couple of slices of white bread, crusts off and pulsed in a food processor), egg yolks and a dash of Worcestershire Sauce.  I use the yolks only as it makes for a rich and delicious hamburger.  Using whites tends to dry it out a bit.  Mix well, season with salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper and form into very thick hamburger patties the same diameter as the hamburger buns.  I usually leave the patties for about 30 minutes so that all the flavours come together, but it's not really necessary.\n\r\n3.  Heat some more oil in an oven-safe frypan  and brown the patties on both sides.  Either transfer the patties to small oven-safe tray or if the pan can fit in your oven just pour over the hot tomato sauce, cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes at 180C.  While the \"meatballs\" are cooking, you can prepare the Parmesan and Chili Fries (see separate recipe).\n\r\n4.  After 30 minutes, uncover the meatballs and top each one with a couple of thick slices of fresh mozzarella. Return to the oven for a further 5 minutes while you toast the buns.  The cheese will melt gloriously over the whole hamburger (not shown very well in the photo so the next time I make this I'll take a better shot).  It really does look amazing when you pull the tray out of the oven and there are 4 perfect patties swimming in a rich and flavourful tomato sauce and covered with melted fresh mozarella. Toast the buns under the grill until browned on both sides.  \n\r\n5.  Top each bun with a meatball hamburger, making sure to scoop up the the cheese and sauce with it.  Serve with the giardiniera, olives, sundried tomatoes and Parmesan and Chili Fries.\n\r\nI like the flavour of these just as is, without any other condiments or toppings.  I couple of nice butter lettuce leaves go quite nicely but I would recommend leaving it at that.  It doesn't really need mustard or mayonnaise or any other salad ingredients to detract from the taste of the meatball.  It's quite rich but the piquancy of the Giardiniera is a good foil for the richness.  But of course, don't eat this every day...\n\r\nMakes 4 medium-sized burgers."}

Remove the skin and fat from the chicken breast.  From the centre of the breast cut down halfway on the long axis and then across to the right and to the left inside the meat.  Fold out the flaps and that should leave you with a flattened chicken breast.  Diagonally cut the meat into long, thin strips and transfer them to a bowl.  Add salt and nihonshu and leave to marinade while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.\n\r\n2.  Take about 10 aojiso leaves per breast and cut them through along the long axis.  Lay the halves on top of each other and roll them up.  Now very finely julienne the leaves so you are left with fine threads of the shiso.  Put them in a bowl and mix in a roughly equal amount of the ito-tougarashi.\n\r\n3.  In yet another bowl, add in an egg white (1-2 per breast also) and beat until slightly frothy.\n\r\n4.  Heat some frying oil in a wok or deep fryer to around 150-160C (at that temperature, small bubbles (but no big ones) should rise from the ends of a pair of wooden chopsticks as soon as you dip them in).  You don't want the oil too hot because you are not trying to brown the meat.  \n\r\n5.  Pour off any excess nihonshu from the chicken and add in a couple of tablespoons of cornflour. Mix thoroughly (using a pair of chopsticks is easiest from here on in) and then transfer first to the egg white and then to the shredded shiso and tougarashi.  Mix well and then start adding the chicken to the oil.  You'll want work quickly and to do this one piece at a time, or else you will be left with either a stuck together mass of chicken or burnt parts. \n\r\n6.  The chicken should only take 45 seconds or so.  The chicken should still be mostly white and the shiso and tougarashi crispy but not discoloured.  The fast cooking time and egg white make for a very soft and tender chicken (unlike many fried chicken dishes), which contrasts brilliantly with the crisp coating.  Drain on some paper and make the dipping sauce.\n\r\n7.  The dipping sauce couldn't be easier.  Assuming you're using a good-quality prepared tentsuyu (although it is incredibly easy to make from scratch also) you just put that in a bowl and add in your cranberry juice to taste.  I use an organic cranberry pulp but any cranberry juice will do.\n\r\n8.  Now just plate the chicken and serve with the sauce."}

Pour boiling water into the roasting tray so it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins carefully, ensuring that it doesn't splash INTO the ramekins. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the custard is just set.\r\n6. Remove from the oven, cool ramekins on a rack, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (They can be prepared up to 24 hours in advance.)\r\n7. To serve, sprinkle a 1mm layer of sugar over each ramekin, and blowtorch to melt the sugar. If you don't have a blowtorch, you can place it under a very hot grill, but watch carefully to make sure the sugar doesn't burn. Anyway, you should just go get yourself a blowtorch. They aren't that expensive and they're so much more fun! :)\n\r\n##Variations:\r\n- For black sesame cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, substitute the vanilla pod with 2 tbsp of black sesame paste, and increase the amount of sugar to 5 tbsp. (The picture has me blowtorching black sesame ones.)\r\n- Fresh berries can also be added to the bottom of the ramekins, using the vanilla recipe."}

You'll probably need about 15 medium sized strawberries to cover the top of the tart.  Put the berry flat side down on a cutting board and use your thumb and index finger to hold the widest part of the strawberry near the base.  Using a good sharp knife, cut the strawberries into thinnish slices.  Discard the ends.  (You can eat those as you go, yum!)  You should get about 4-5 slices per berry.  Fan the slices out and put them on the tart.  (It's better if you let the tart cool for a while.)  Work from the outside in, overlapping each the same way for the entire top.  For the center, choose a small berry and let the slices stand, like a flower.\n\r\nTo make them shine and to spruce up out-of-season berries, take 2 tablespoons of sugar and mix well with hot water (about 1/4 cup).  Brush the strawberries with the sugar glaze.  They will look AWESOME and smell really really good.\n\r\nEnjoy!\n\r\n(P.S. Thanks goes to Jai for great inspiration and basic recipe!!)"}

Divide each baguette into three parts, I find this the most suitable for easy handling. You could of course just chop it in half, or into four.\r\n2. Using a pair of chopsticks (other utensils don't do the job as well), start digging the \"insides\" of the bread out, leaving 1/2 cm from the crust. You want it quite hollow. Don't throw the dug out stuff away. You'll still need it. \r\n3. Boil and mash the potatoes.\r\n4. Chop the \"bread innards\" up.\r\n5. In a GINORMOUS bowl, put the cream cheese and 1/2 cup of mayo in, and start creaming them together. It helps if the cheese is soft. \r\n6. Add salt and pepper.\r\n7. Chuck in the mashed potatoes, egg, sausages, and half of the chopped bread. Mix.\r\n8. Taste. Now, at this point, if the mixture is a bit dry, add more mayo or cheese. If it looks like it can take more chopped up bread, chuck in more. As I said, it all depend on YOU. \r\n9. Now for the OMG ITS SO BORING PART. I usually get the people who requested this bread to help me with it. Taking a spoon, scoop the mixture back into the hollowed out bread crust. You want the \"bread tube\" to be FIRM. And I mean FIRM. Squish as much mixture as you can into the tubes as humanely possible. If you divide the bread into three like me, the two ends are easier to do as no mix will fall off the other end. \r\n10. Wrap in aluminium foil. There's a trick to this, you can't just haphazardly wrap it up, you have to leave around 1/2 cm of \"breathing space\" surrounding the bread. According to mum, this is so more heat can circulate the bread, and makes it crispier on the outside. \r\n11. Bake in a preheated 180C oven for around 20-30 minutes. \r\n12. Slice into slices using a bread knife (Trust me, you don't want to use any other kind of knife.)\n\r\n1 loaf feeds around 4 girls, the other loaf is usually for breakkie the next morning.

In the morning, punch down the dough and knead with wet hands.  You want to over knead this dough and make it wet in order to give it the chewy texture that English Muffins are supposed to have.  Continually wet your hands until the dough is very sticky.  Divide this sticky dough into eight globs.\n\r\n3. As best you can, form the wet globs into disks and lay them out on a clean surface dusted with cornmeal or flour so that they don't stick.  Let them sit until they have doubled.  (my dough was pretty cold so it took about 1 hour).\n\r\n4. Carefully without deflating the dough, transfer the disks to a preheated, dry, heavy skillet or frying pan. The frying pan should be set lower than you would for pancakes. Turn each muffin after five minutes - 10 minutes on each side - approx 20 minutes total cooking time.  If they cook too fast they will taste flat and doughy!\n\r\n5. Split the muffins by poking all around the edge with a fork and then pulling it apart on the last poke.

Correct the seasoning if necessary, and set aside in the refrigerator.\n\r\nNote: You will have about 5x the amount of dressing you need, so refrigerate the leftover in a tightly sealed container. It's difficult to make it in any smaller amount, and anyway it's always nice to have some homemade dressing in the fridge.\n\r\n##Bread rings:\r\n1. Using a small cylindrical tin as the mould (or a medium sized cucumber), grease the outside of the tin, then wrap one slice of bread around it. Secure with kitchen string.\r\n2. Deep fry the bread in oil over medium heat until golden brown.\r\n3. Remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper. When cool enough to handle, remove the string and re-grease the tin.\r\n4. Repeat until you have 5 bread rings.\n\r\n##Other Garnishes:\r\n1. Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C.\r\n2. Place the pancetta on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper and bake for 15 minutes until crispy. You may need to weigh it down so it remains flat.\r\n3. Boil the quails eggs in simmering water in a saucepan for 2.5 minutes. Remove from the saucepan, and let it cool in an ice bath. Peel, and set aside.\n\r\n##Cajun Prawns:\r\n1. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a non-stick pan.\r\n2. Dust the prawns with the cajun spice mix, pressing it into the prawns.\r\n3. Pan fry them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, on high heat, turning once.\n\r\nNote: If you can't find cajun spice mix, you can blitz up black peppercorns, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, paprika, chilli powder, dried thyme, garlic and onionpowder and some salt in a food processor. Be sure to toast the spices before blitzing.\n\r\n##Assembly:\r\n1. Toss the salad leaves in the dressing.\r\n2. Place one bread ring on a plate, and fill the ring with the dressed cos leaves.\r\n3. Hook 2 prawns over each bread ring.\r\n4. Garnish with pancetta, quails eggs, and the marinated anchovies on the side. (I burnt the pancetta so I just crumbled the unburnt pieces over)\r\n5. Sprinkle with black pepper, and the shaved Parmesan.\r\n6. Serve, and enjoy!"}
{"cook_time": "20 Min", "portions": "6", "description": "Duck confit is a fairly popular dish, and while it's rather time-consuming to prepare (it takes about 3-4 days from start to finish), it's really nice to have some confit in your fridge, that you can just take out, reheat, and shred into a salad or a pie or something. Super yummy. The best part about making duck confit for me - apart from eating it, that is - is that I get to eat potatoes fried in duck fat! They're my absolutely favouritest way to eat potatoes, and since you can't always find bottled rendered duck or goose fat, it's quite a treat to have it this way. Anyway, duck fat can be strained and reused, so it should go quite a long way. Just make sure you seal it properly before storing, and always smell and check it before using, 'cos I've got a friend whose duck fat went rancid after a stint in his freezer. :(\r\n\r\nThis recipe's one of the more time-consuming ways to make confit, but I think it's worth it. The initial 24-hour cure of the duck legs in salt really adds to the flavour, and curing it for longer means you can use less salt, so you don't get an overly salty confit. Try it! (Serves 6.)", "title": "Confit de Canard with Pommes Sarladaise", "ingredients": ["3 whole ducks (yes, you need the whole ducks to get enough fat to confit the legs, and pick the fattiest looking ones)", "sea salt, and ground black pepper", "2 heads of garlic, one separated into individual cloves and bruised with the back of a knife. (No need to peel)", "1 shallot, quartered", "2 oranges", "mirepoix of onion, leek and carrot", "1 star anise", "1 cinnamon quill", "black peppercorns", "600g red-skinned potatoes"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/confit-de-canard-with-pommes-sarladaise", "prep_time": "120 Min", "method": "1. Remove the legs and breasts from the ducks, and set aside. (Breasts can be frozen for later use.) Remove all the skin and fat from the ducks and place into a heavy-based saucepan. Cut up the carcasses and place in an oven (at about 180\u00b0C) in a roasting tray together with all the wings etc for about 40 minutes.\r\n2. Rub about 4-5 tbsp of salt on the duck legs, putting more salt on the skin side. Rub in about 2 tbsp of pepper as well. Place the legs in a single, snug layer - skin side up - in an ovenproof dish/pan. (The dish should be deep enough so that there's at least 2 inches of space above the ducks.) Scatter the peel of one orange, and all the garlic on top of the duck. Seal tightly with clingfilm and keep in the fridge for 24 hours.\r\n3. Cut the fat up into small pieces, and place the saucepan over medium heat to render the fat. If there is a lot of fat, you can strain the oil out periodically. Keep heating it until all the fat and skin looks crispy, and you can't render anymore fat out. Strain through a chinois, pressing with the back of a wooden spoon to squeeze out every last bit of fat. Cover the container and keep in the fridge until ready to use. (You should be able to get about 3 cups of fat.)\r\n4. Remove the roasting tray from the oven, and place the bones and meat into a stock pot. Pour all the fat out, and strain it twice through a chinois, then using a muslin cloth to remove the impurities. Add this to the oil rendered from the skin and fat.\r\n5. Place about 1-2 cups of water into the roasting tray, and heat it over the stove, scraping all the bits from the bottom. Pour it all into the stock pot over the bones. Add the mirepoix in, and top up the water so it covers all the bones. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat to the lowest and simmer for 3-4 hours, skimming all the impurities off. Remove the bones, strain, then keep the stock in the refrigerator or freezer. (You can use it as the base of a soup, or reduce and make a sauce.)\r\n6. After 24 hours in the fridge, the duck legs will look wet, as the water has been drawn out by the salt. Discard the orange peel and garlic cloves. Pat the duck legs dry with kitchen paper, and place back into the dish, in a snug single layer, skin-side up again.\r\n7. Heat the rendered fat over low heat in a small saucepan until it is completely melted (it would have solidified in the fridge).\r\n8. Remove the peel of the second orange with a peeler, and place the peel onto a medium sheet of muslin. Place the cinnamon quill, star anise, shallot and some black peppercorns (about 1 tbsp should suffice) onto the muslin, then gather up the edges and tie securely with kitchen twine. Tie the second head of garlic into another muslin-bag.\r\n9. Place the two muslin bags into the dish, and pour over the melted duck fat. Place in a preheated oven at 125\u00b0C, and cook for 3-5 hours. The meat should come off the bone very easily by the time it's done.\r\n10. Remove the duck legs carefully from the dish, and place into another container. Strain the oil, and pour enough in to just submerge the duck legs. Let it cool, then cover tightly and refrigerate. It will keep in the fridge for about 6 weeks. The rest of the duck fat can be strained and kept separately if desired.\r\n11. To serve, remove the duck legs from the fat, brush off the oil, and heat up about 1/4 cup of the duck fat in a large heavy-based skillet. (You want it to almost deep fry.) Place the ducks skin side down in the hot fat, and fry until the skin is crispy. Turn over and cook for one additional minute on the other side.\r\n12. Place the reheated ducks on a tray, and keep these in an oven preheated to 120\u00b0C.\r\n13. Top up the fat if necessary, then fry some parboiled sliced potatoes in the duck fat until golden and crispy on both sides. Serve with the duck legs and a glaze made with balsamic vinegar, the jus from the duck carcasses, and the juice from one or two oranges, reduced until syruppy.\r\n14. Sprinkle over some sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and serve. :)\n\r\nIt'll be worth all the trouble, I promise."}

Having been past so many pastry shops recently and seeing all the delicious tarts topped with summer fruits, I thought I will experiment with a fruit cake that has a fruit layered on the top just like the summer tarts. After some research I realised this is what the cake people call an Upside Down Cake, and pineapple is commonly as the fruit topping. I have decided to use pears as the topping, with a thin layer of almonds just underneath for the crunchy texture, and all sits on a light orange sponge for that summer citrus finish.

If you have an electric whisk, you can just sieve the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl, then add the rest of the ingredients for the orange sponge. Whisk it all together until you have a well combined and smooth mixture. \n\r\n2. If you don't have an electric whisk, like me, you will just have to resort to the traditional method of cake making! First combine the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl, using a wooden spoon, until you get a light yellow, smooth mixture. Seive the flour and baking powder into the same mixing bowl (hold the sieve up high, so you get lots of air into the mixture), then add your whisked eggs bit by bit. Blend it all together using a dessert spoon, drawing a figure of 8 in the cake batter, folding the mixture together. \n\r\n3. Next caramelize the pears by melting the butter in a pan and the light brown sugar, then add the pear slices and cook for about couple of minutes on each side. \n\r\n4. Grease your cake tins and line with baking parchment. Remember to grease the inside of the baking parchment too. \n\r\n5. Place the pears in a layer on the bottom, then sprinkle a thin layer of almonds before pouring in the cake mixture. \n\r\n6. Bake in the oven till golden brown. To test if the cake is done, you can push your finger gently in the centre and if the sponge springs back leaving no impressions, it's ready. Make sure to not open the oven door too soon, as you may deflate the cake while it's still rising. \n\r\n7. When done, leave to cool then peel back the baking parchment to see your wonderful up side down cake! \n\r\nGently dust with some icing sugar and serve with a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or some vanilla ice cream!\n\r\n**For the cake you see in the picture, I actually used one of those glass pots you get when you buy one those expensive chocolate desserts from the supermarket.

Take a rolling pin or long, thick stick and flatten as much as you can get it without it tearing. It'll fry quite quickly so to make sure the dough cooks evenly you'll need it thin. To keep it circular roll over half and rotate the dough slightly (same idea as making gyoza wrappers) \n\r\nSpoon on your sauce, cheese, herbs, and any other fillings you want. Add another round of dough on top and seal the sides firmly with your fingers so oil doesn't get it (that baby will splatter like Sylvester cat on crack if you don't).\n\r\nDeep fry or pan fry in a few centimeters of oil. If deep frying, splash some of the oil on the top to more evenly cook it. If you've made it thin enough the insides should be cooked by the time it's browned, but if not turn down the heat down a bit so the dough can cook through.\n\r\nPut on a drying rack or in paper towels to get rid of excess oil.

Do not leave the pan or the mixture will burn.\r\n4. When the mixture comes together into a lump (paste) continue cooking it for about a minute (just to ensure that the flour is all cooked out).\r\n5. Remove from heat\r\n6. Beat the 2 eggs lightly, then pour a little bit into the flour paste. Mix in well to combine.\r\n7. Continue adding the remainder of the egg, bit by bit and make sure you mix well after each addition.\r\n8. Towards the end, the mixture will become quite sticky, then add the extra 1/2 egg, mix well again.\r\n9. Continue mixing until the gluten has formed. It's ready when the paste becomes stringy, sticky and smooth.\r\n10. Place in a piping bag, and pipe out mounds of the pastry (you can make huge ones, or tiny bite size, just remember it will expand during baking, so leave enough space in between)\r\n11. Wet your finger tip with water, and press down the peaks on your choux mounds. By doing this, you'll definetly get perfectly rounded surface instead of a peak *_^\r\n12.

Take out and let cool before filling them.\n\r\nCustard Cream Filling :\n\r\n1. In a large bowl, place the egg yolk and half of the sugar. Whisk until slightly thick. Set aside.\r\n2.

Return the mixture into the pan and place on low heat. \r\n9. Add in the Vanilla Bean Paste or Vanilla Bean\r\n10. Again, do not stop stirring ! Keep stirring until the mixture thickens to a custard consistency.\r\n11. Remove from heat, add in the Vanilla extract (or Green Tea paste or Coffee mixture), Cointreau and butter. Mix well\r\n12. Place a cling film on the surface of the custard before putting it into the fridge to completely cool. The film will prevent skin formation when it's cooled."}

Use a ring mould or a springform tin without the base to hold the shape (If you have acetate film handy, line the sides with the film. If not, not to worry).\r\n2. Place the brownie in the centre, then pour half of the mousse mixture.\r\n3. Arrange a layer of raspberry on the mousse, leave about 1cm space on the side.\r\n4. Pour in the remainding mousse, smooth the surface and allow to set in the fridge for few hours or overnight.\r\n5. To take it out, if you use acetate film, just strip the film of.

There, I had a dish which was pancetta-wrapped cod with vanilla, accompanied by a roasted fig.  It was absolutely, mind-blowingly delicious.  I tried to recreate it at home, but for this recipe I omitted the figs as I've never cooked with them before and I totally destroyed them.  What remained - the fish and the veg, was more than satisfactory, however.\r\n\r\nThe secret is in the vanilla, which doesn't lend too much flavour, but scents the dish with a welcoming, warming sweet smell, and the contrast between the salty pancetta and sweet, pan-roasted vegetables.  I used carrots and shallots here, but really any veg that has a natural sweetness would work well.  I think this would be equally great with a pumpkin or swede mash.", "title": "Pancetta-Wrapped Cod with Vanilla", "ingredients": ["For the cod:", "- a small, boneless cod fillet", "thin slices of pancetta, about 5 per piece of cod", "vanilla oil", "olive oil, butter", "splash of brandy", "For the veg (one portion):", "- 1 carrot, diced", "4 or 5 shallots, halved", "2 cloves of garlic, peeled and whole", "fresh thyme leaves, a scattering", "olive oil, butter"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/pancetta-wrapped-cod-with-vanilla", "prep_time": "15 Min", "method": "1. Lay a piece of cling film down on a flat surface.  Line up your strips of pancetta so that they are just overlapping slightly.  Season the cod sparingly - you won't need too much salt as the pancetta is already salty, but a good grinding of black pepper wouldn't go amiss.  Lay the cod on top of the pancetta and dot with vanilla oil.  Fresh vanilla pod scrapings would be even better I imagine.  Carefully wrap the parcel using the cling film (a similar technique if you've ever made maki-zushi).  Wrap it evenly - if it's wrapped evenly, it will cook evenly.  Store it  wrapped in the fridge until you are ready - this will help it keep its shape.\n\r\n2. Heat some oil and butter in a pan and begin to roast off your carrots, shallots and garlic.  These will be cooking for a while on a low heat so you don't need to blanche the carrots first.  Season with salt and pepper and leave to bubble on the lowest heat possible.\n\r\n3. In another pan, you need to seal your cod parcel.  Remove the pancetta parcel from the cling film.  Heat some oil (and a little butter if you so please) to a fairly high heat, and let your parcel sit on the hot oil for a few seconds on each side.  Splash a bit of brandy on it and let it sizzle.  When you have sealed the parcel, you can do one of two things - transfer it to a preheated oven to cook through, or turn the heat right down and put the lid on the pan.  I did the latter (for lack of an oven) and it turned out just fine.\n\r\n4.  Your vegetables should be getting a little colour on them.  Toss in some fresh thyme leaves.  Remove the garlic from the pan - it has done its job now.\n\r\n5. After a few further minutes (6 - 7 is enough) of cooking, the cod parcel should be cooked through.  Remove it from the pan and let it rest for a minute or so.\n\r\n6. Spoon the veg onto a plate.  Decorate with a thyme sprig if you have one left over.  Slice the cod diagonally, breath in the sweet fragrance of the vanilla, roasted onion and thyme wafting up from the plate bfore you, drizzle with olive oil and serve.\n\r\n**Bonus Eats!**\n\r\nDon't throw away those garlic cloves that are now probably all soft and browned from the pan.

On the cooking side, this means good, seasonal ingredients where the role of the chef is to bring out their natural characteristics and push them further through combinations of flavours, and on the eating side, it means food where people can come together and eat without pretension, but without sacrificing quality or experience.\n\nBasically, this is an interesting steamed vegetable dish to serve at a winter dinner party in place of ordinary vegetables or a salad.  The concept and service of the dish was intended to be both simple and spectacular at the same time. \n\nTo start, prepare the condiments.  \n\n**For the Jasmine Tea Salt**, grind a small amount of dry jasmine tea leaves and flowers in a mortar and pestle.  Then add in a very good quality mineral salt and combine with the pestle.  Done.\n\n**For the Spiced Mayonnaise**, take about 2 tablespoons of good quality prepared mayonnaise and mix through half a teaspoon of turmeric, and about a quarter teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, ground cumin and smoked paprika.  Set aside for at least half an hour for the colour and flavour to develop.\n\n**For the Black Butter**, first toast some black sesame seeds in a dry pan until fragrant.  Add 2/3 of the sesame seeds to a small food processor (reserving the rest for serving) and add in softened butter, Fortnam & Mason's Anchovy Alchemy (this is a delicious condiment, or substitute anchovy fillets to taste), capers, Caramel Sauce, a little garlic, a squeeze of lemon and lots of freshly ground black pepper.  Process until combined.\n\nThen it's time for the vegetables.\n\nAny winter vegetables will do, but I have used here (grouped in order of cooking time):   New Potatoes, Sweet Potato, Jerusalem Artichoke, (around 12 minutes) Baby Corn, Parsnip, Baby Carrot,  Baby Cabbage (I don't think I know what this is, it was like a Brussel Sprout but looked exactly like a tiny cabbage), Cauliflower (both white and purple), Broccoli, Romanesco (the extraordinary fractal shaped vegetable similar to broccoli that you can see hiding behind the carrot)(all around 5 minutes),  Goubo (burdock root),  Radish, Red Chicory, and Snow Peas (1-2 minutes).  Plus Ginko Nuts for presentation.\n\nOK, I probably went overboard with the selection here, but this is supposed to be a celebration of winter vegetables.  \n\nScrub them well but leave the skins on everything.  As a harvest dish the skins give the dish the earthy quality it needs.  I'm very fond of the Jerusalem Artichoke and Goubo for that  particular characteristic in this dish.  \n\nIf using the fresh Ginko Nuts like I did, you need to prepare this by cracking them out of their shells (the handle of the knife brought down on the seam of the nut will do this well, without squashing the nut).  Put the nuts in a bowl, pour over boiling water and sit for 10 minutes to loosen the inner skin.  Peel the nuts and then simmer in more water for 20-30 minutes to cook.  These are the only thing that was cooked separately.  The rest were done in the steamer.  And that's the fun part.\n\nCut all the vegetables to the size you like and lay them out on a cutting board in order of cooking time.  Set a countdown timer and add the vegetables in reverse cooking time order, so that they are all ready at the same time.  The vegetables should still be quite firm and \"al dente\".\n\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, plate up the condiments as shown in the picture.  As soon as the vegetables are done, arrange them in the steamer how you would like them to be presented and get them straight to the table.  Steamed vegetables go cold very quickly so I suggest improvising some kind of steam warmer for the table.  I did this with the antique wooden dish I bought at a market with a deep plate inside it filled with the steaming water, with the steamer placed on top of the whole thing.  \n\nThe dish itself looks quite spectacular when it's brought to the table, but it's not fussy or contrived at all.  When everyone just dives in with their hands and attacks the condiments on shared dishes, it's as casual an experience as you could ask for.  \n\nWhile of course any of the condiments can go with any of the vegetables, I was blown away by the combination of the parsnip with the Jasmine Tea Salt and the potatoes with the Black Butter.  The sweetness of the parsnip matched perfectly with the aroma of the jasmine, and the texture of the sesame and saltiness of the anchovy was amazing with the warm potato.\n\nGood food.  Good company.  Perfect."}

The book is a collection of recipes sent in by the \"Chefs-of-the-West\"; male food enthusiasts from all walks of life, from pilots and retired military officers to plumbers and accountants, that submitted recipes to be published in Sunset magazine over the preceding decade. \r\n \r\nPost-war 1950's America is not really a place or period you would generally associate with male cooks, culinary experimentation or inter-cultural understanding (Arkansas was still using the National Guard to prevent blacks from enrolling in schools and Mickey Rooney was probably reading scripts to play Japanese stereotypes) but the recipes in this book show the desire of the contributors to explore other cultures and foods.  There are recipes for Spanish rice, Chinese ribs, Lebanese dips, Slavic borscht, Japanese tempura, French stews etc., all cobbled together from what these cooks could find in their 1950's supermarkets.\r\n \r\nSo in homage to that pioneering spirit, I made this using the kind of ingredients those 1950's cooks would have used, and put it together in the style of the time.  Economy of ingredients and processes; bold flavours, primary elements and a basic, geometric construction.  This was not a traditional Italian lasagne by any means, but it had a different kind of authenticity to it.  It genuinely tasted to me like how I would've imagined a 1950s Californian lasagna.  I loved it, and really enjoyed the process of making it. \r\n \r\nToday, an American lasagna differs from a traditional Italian lasagne in that the bechamel is replaced by a cottage cheese mixture (sometimes using eggs or shredded processed mozarella), but I think that was a development through the '70s, so this recipe uses a cheese sauce like I've seen in some earlier American lasagna recipes.  The original 1950 first edition of Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook had an American lasagna recipe but I have not been able to find it.  If anyone has that recipe I'd love to have a look at it.", "title": "1950's American Lasagna", "ingredients": ["Meat Sauce:", "Vegetable Oil - Ground Beef - Onion - Garlic - Tinned Tomatoes - Dried Oregano - Dried Basil - Tomato Ketchup", "Cheese Sauce:", "Butter - Flour - Milk - Dried Bay Leaf - Ground Nutmeg - Grated American Cheddar Cheese - Grated Parmesan Cheese", "Dried Lasagne Sheets"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/1950s-american-lasagna-1", "prep_time": "10 Min", "method": "1.  Start with the Meat Sauce.  Chop the onion and garlic and saute with oil in a pot or deep pan until softened.  Add in the ground beef and brown.  Add in the diced tinned tomatoes, dried herbs and ketchup.  Cover and simmer for an hour or so.\n\r\n2.  For the Cheese Sauce, start by heating some milk in a saucepan with the bay leaf and half an onion (unchopped).  Heat the butter in another saucepan and add in the flour when melted to make a firm paste.  Cook through for a minute or two (without browning) and add in the hot milk a little at a time, working it after each addition to make sure there are no lumps.  You need to cook the bechamel for around 20-30 minutes to cook out the raw flour flavour, so add more milk so that it doesn't become too thick.  After 20-30 minutes add in grated cheeses to taste and ground nutmeg.\n\r\n3.  Cook the lasagne sheets in boiling salted water for a few minutes until softened.  Lay these out on a damp towel while you wait.\n\r\n4.  Build the lasagne (in an oiled pyrex dish for added 1950's authenticity) with a layer of meat sauce, then cheese sauce, then pasta, etc.  End with a layer of cheese sauce and add more of both cheeses to the top.  Cover with foil and bake at 180C for around an hour, uncovering for the last 10-15 minutes to brown the cheese.  Let the lasagne cool out of the oven for 20 minutes or so before serving with a salad.\n\r\nEach of the recipes in the book were also signed by the contributors, so I thought I'd do that too.  Identity thieves please note that this is actually my real signature so I'd appreciate you not using it for forging cheques and buying imaginary houses and whatnot.  Thanks a bunch."}

Something that's not too demanding, but looks it.\r\n\r\nThis is just a recipe for the squash topping. Serve it warm on something cold and mild.

Preheat the oven to like 350F. Put your pizza stone on the middle rack if using, and allow an extra 20 minutes for oven to heat up.\n\r\n2. Peel and dice the squash. Small cubes! See the photo. You want to be able to get a pecan piece, squash cube, and a bit of ice cream in each spoonful if you can.\n\r\n3. In a mixing bowl add the squash and say a half- to a whole teaspoon of spice mixture. About a tablespoon of honey, or just enough that you think it might coat the squash, and a splash of vinegar just enough to loosen the honey, just a few drops of sesame oil, and stir it all up so that the spices are evenly distributed and the squash is covered in the glaze.\n\r\n4. Line a 9\"x9\" baking pan with foil, going all the way up the sides so you make sort of a disposable pan out of tinfoil. Seriously do this. Burnt caramel is **not easy to clean.** Pour in the squash cubes and spread them out in a single layer, then drizzle with your neutral oil a little bit. You don't need a ton, just a tablespoon or so. Oven (on the stone if using) and bake for a while, stirring every 15 minutes or so.\n\r\n5. The glaze will begin to bubble and darken. While it's still quite liquid, take out the hot pan, stir, then spread out the squash again and sprinkle with sugar. You want to get a good sparkling layer of sugar going here, it'll take a handful or two. I estimate half a cup? Back in the oven to caramelise. Watch it carefully. Eventually the syrup will begin to harden and sizzle in the oil\u2014this is where it gets risky. By this time the squash will be a deep red or mahogany colour, and should be going translucent. When it's as dark as you dare, take it out of the oven and simply lift the foil lining out of the pan. Set this aside somewhere and put your pecans in the still-hot, empty baking pan (which you have towelled dry if any steam has condensed on it).\n\r\n6. Turn off the oven.\n\r\n7. Put the nuts in the oven (stone again) and just leave them there to toast in the residual heat until you can smell them. Then pour them over the cooling squash, put your pan liner thingy in the baking pan again for stability, and stir it all up. The remains of the caramel and oil should glaze the pecans nicely."}

When it starts to boil, gently tip one saucer at a time into the water where the bubbles are, then use a spoon to swirl the water around the egg to create a \u2018whirlpool\u2019. Let it cook for about 45 seconds over medium-low heat, and when cooked (press gently on the yolk to ascertain if it is done to your liking), remove using a slotted spoon, and transfer to an ice bath to arrest the cooking process.\n2. Repeat with the rest of the eggs. When all the eggs are cooked, use a small knife to trim the edges. This can be done up to 2 days in advance and stored in the fridge in a bowl of cold water.\n3. Make the hollandaise by mixing the white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp cold water and the crushed white peppercorns in a small saucepan. Reduce by one third, and leave to cool. Add the egg yolk to the cold reduction and whisk. Place the saucepan on a heat diffuser and whisk continuously until the sauce emulsifies, becoming smooth and creamy after 8-10 minutes, with the heat gradually increasing. Do not allow the temperature to rise above 65C.\n4. Remove the pan from the heat, and - still whisking - drizzle the tepid clarified butter in a steady stream. Stir in the lemon juice, and pass the sauce through a muslin lined chinois to eliminate the peppercorns. Season with salt and white pepper to taste and set aside.\n5. Use a 4cm pastry cutter and cut two rounds from each slice of bread. Toast the bread lightly on both sides until golden, then brush one side with the melted butter and keep warm.\n6. Heat a small saucepan of water to a simmer, then immerse all the eggs in for 10-15 seconds, just to warm through.\n7. To serve, place one toasted round on each plate, buttered side up. Top with two poached quails eggs. Cover half of each quails egg with some Hollandaise, then serve \na little extra on the side in a small spoon.

This part's tricky, toss the Portobello in the heated skillet - cook both sides. WHILE you're doing this watch your bread - you want your bread to get a golden/darkened hue / crispy around the EDGES - this will allow the middle of your bread to retain a nice softness and not be too crunch and dry. This will also allow the bread to absorb the oil/spices dripping from the Portobello.

When the 30 minutes are up, run cold water over the pressure cooker to lower the pressure and safely remove the lid. You should at that very moment get a wonderful aroma of sake, ginger and pork.

At this point, I gingerly transfer the pork to a seperate place (be careful, they are pretty damn soft at this point) and strain the cooked sauce to get the ginger and green onion bits out and transfer some of the broth back into the pot (I saved about 1/2 for future use).\n\n5. Put the pork back into the pot with the broth and add the soy sauce, mirin, sugar and radish (you can at this point also put soft- boiled peeled eggs).

Once cooked, let the mixture completely cool. This is an important step as stuffing the pastry with hot filling would result in soggy empanadas.2. Start working on the crust:a. Combine:2 C flour + 1 t salt + 1 T sugarb. Mix 3/4 stick COLD butter (cut into small pieces) and flour mixture with your hands (make sure they're clean!) until the mixture forms small crumbs.c. gradually add 1/3 C ice cold h20 (1 T at a time; mix in between each addition) until the dough forms a ball. Make sure not to overknead. That will result in a tough dough.d.\nWrap the 'ball' of dough in seran/plastic wrap and chill for 30 mins to\n1 hr at the least.\u00a0 It's easier to work with the dough when it's cooled.******3. Assemble.a. Prepare and dust the work surface and rolling pin with flour to avoid the dough from sticking; Preheat oven to 350dF.b.\nTake a golf-ball size of dough and work the dough with a rolling pin\nuntil it's four times its original size. Start rolling from the center\nuntil it forms a bigger circle. Naturally, a small circle would produce\na small empanada while a big circle, well you guessed it, produces a\nbig-sized empanada. So adjust the size of the dough circles to how big\nor small you prefer the finished product to be.c. Plaze 1-2 T of the filling on one side of the filling.d.\nFold one side of the dough over the filling until it touches the other\nedge. More advanced cooks would be able to make pretty folds along the\nedges, but it's much easier (while equally nice) to just seal the edges\nwith fork. Trim the excess dough.e. Place the empanadas on a greased baking sheet. f. Brush the empanadas with egg wash to achieve a golden color. To make the egg wash, combine 1 egg and 1 t H20.e. Bake until golden.4. Buen provecho!"}

Feta is usually pretty salty so you probably don\u2019t need to\r\nadd any salt. My feta was a bit lacking in the salt department so I\r\nadded a pinch. My feta was also pretty soft, so I didn\u2019t need to use an\r\negg to bind it together, but if your filling is too crumbly, add an egg\r\nat this point.\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. To make the rolls, just drop about\r\na tablespoon of filling onto a piece of eggplant and roll. I used an\r\n8?x8? glass pyrex, so I had 3 rows of 4 in the pan. Cover the rolls\r\nwith tomato sauce then top with the slices of fresh mozarella. I\r\nsprinkled some paprika on top of the cheese for a bit of color.\n\r\nBake for 30-45 minutes until the sauce is nice and bubbly and the\r\ncheese has browned a bit on top.

Also good because it's a bugger to clean the pasta machine.\r\n\r\nAs you can see though it's pretty easy to adjust the amounts to whatever amount of pasta you want, as they are sort of in a 1:1 ratio. 150g feeds one person so 600 g will serve 4.\r\n\r\nThe basic pasta dough can be left overnight. It also freezes very well. It may turn a very dark brown but don't be alarmed. It's only on the outside and once you roll it all out it will turn back into an eggy yellow colour.\r\n\r\nThere is no salt in the pasta because salt is hygroscopic. It will tend to make your pasta soggy and flabby. Better to simply salt the boiling water well.\r\n\r\nIt's actually surprisingly easy to make. I thought it would be very messy but it isn't, either.\r\n\r\nLastly, the recipe is pretty much from \"Cook with Jamie\" by Jamie Oliver. I looked at a few pasta dough recipes and felt this was the best.", "title": "Fresh Egg Pasta", "ingredients": ["1 kg of tipo 00 flour/farina di granaro tenero", "10 of the\u00a0best and freshest\u00a0large free range eggs you can find.", "Extra tipo 00 flour (or plain flour) for dusting."], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/fresh-egg-pasta1", "prep_time": "40 Min", "method": "Place flour on a huge table (or a huge bowl). Make a well in the centre and crack eggs into center. Using a fork beat the eggs. Bring the flour into the beaten eggs, little by little until the mixture gets so thick you're not in danger of having eggs spilling all over the table. Start using your hands (flour them) and bring all the flour in.\r\nKnead till elastic, sproingy, smooth and silky. Kneading developes the gluten in the dough.\r\nWrap it well in clingfilm and leave in fridge to rest for at least 30 mins.\r\nCut off about a fist-sized piece of dough. Leave the rest well covered in the clingwrap so it doesn't dry out. Start off with a smaller lump if you are unfamiliar with pasta rolling.\r\nDust with flour and pull it into a roughly rectangular shape. Squish one end thinner so it can be fed through the machine. Run it through the widest setting, then the second widest. Fold it in half and run it through widest setting, then second widest. Do this 3 or so more times until smooth and silky. This helps to work the dough and also give you a chance to neaten up the ends!\r\nAfter that work you way down through all the settings to the narrowest. Lightly dust the dough as you go to prevent stickage.\r\nNow to neaten up the ends. Fold the ends together, then fold lengthwise again and again until you have a roughly squarish package. At the widest setting, feed it through with the edge-that-used-to-be-the-sides first, so you end up with nice straight sides.\r\nWork down through all the settings again. For pappardelle, tagliatelle and lasagne you'll want something thicker (my machine has 7 settings and I stop at 2) and for ravioli and other stuffed pastas it's setting 1. Flour the finished products well!! It would be a pity to go though all that and then find they all stick together because you've been a bit stingy on the flour...\r\nIn my photo I've cut the pasta into rather wide pappardelle type strips. I was going to use it in a chunky tomato sauce and felt the more robust size would help add to the rustic feel of the dish."}

Don\u2019t worry if your first few look bad, they\u2019ll get better and as long as it\u2019s well sealed, it shouldn\u2019t effect the end result much.\n\r\nfry the dumplings\r\nGet a non-stick pan (that has a lid) hot over medium heat, then add about a teaspoon of oil. Place the dumplings in the pan with the flat-side down. Cook for about 1 minute or until the bottoms are just turning light brown.\n\r\nWith the lid ready to cover the pan, add about 2 Tbs of water then quickly put the lid down (be very careful as the pan will start spitting hot oil as soon as you put the water in). Turn down the heat and steam the dumplings for about 4 minutes.\n\r\nRemove the lid, turn up the heat to medium high and let any remaining water evaporate so the dumplings get nice and crisp on the bottom (about another minute). Plate and serve immediately with dipping sauce."}

Rinse the cabbages, then quarter them lengthwise, discard the stems, and then chop the cabbages laterally, which should leave you with the largest pieces measuring perhaps 5 cm on a side.\r\n2.   Place the cabbage in a clean plastic bag or equivalent (with no holes) and sprinkle salt over each layer. The best kind of salt is sea salt, although non-iodized table salt will do. This will create a brine solution with the cabbage juice.  Press the leaves in your hand to squeeze as much water out of them as possible. Once finished, tie up the bag and set it aside for 5-6 hours.\r\n3.  Take the cabbage out of the salt solution and rinse it if necessary. It should be a lot softer than it was. Again, remove surplus water. Place cabbage in a sealable plastic box. Add the spring onions, chopped into small pieces. Crush the garlic and ginger in a press and mix in. You may also add half an onion,\r\n4.  Add the chili powder. Unsurprisingly, the best chili powder for kim chi can be found at a Korean grocery store, which has a bright red color. It is possible to use other kinds of chili powder, or pur\u00e9ed or thinly sliced chili peppers if this is unavailable. If you use hot chili powder, you might want to reduce the amount. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar.  Mash the chili powder into the leaves as you did in much the same way with the salt. If the color doesn\u2019t seem dark enough, add more chili powder. It\u2019s a good idea to wear gloves while doing this.\r\n5.  Put the containers aside for three or four days in a cool location. No snacking. After that, store it in the refrigerator."}

Rinse the chicken, then dry it very well with paper towels, inside and out. The less it steams, the drier the heat, the better.\n\r\nSalt and pepper the cavity, then truss the bird. Trussing is not difficult, and if you roast chicken often, it's a good technique to feel comfortable with. When you truss a bird, the wings and legs stay close to the body; the ends of the drumsticks cover the top of the breast and keep it from drying out. Trussing helps the chicken to cook evenly, and it also makes for a more beautiful roasted bird.\n\r\nNow, salt the chicken\u2014 I like to rain the salt over the bird so that it has a nice uniform coating that will result in a crisp, salty, flavorful skin (about 1 tablespoon). When it's cooked, you should still be able to make out the salt baked onto the crisp skin. Season to taste with pepper. (Love freshly ground pepper!)\n\r\nPlace the chicken in a saut\u00e9 pan or roasting pan and, when the oven is up to temperature, put the chicken in the oven. I leave it alone \u2014 I don't baste it, I don't add butter; you can if you wish, but I feel this creates steam, which I don't want. Roast it until it's done, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove it from the oven and add the thyme, if using, to the pan. Baste the chicken with the juices and thyme and let it rest for 15 minutes on a cutting board.\n\r\nRemove the twine. Separate the middle wing joint and eat that immediately. Remove the legs and thighs. I like to take off the backbone and eat one of the oysters, the two succulent morsels of meat embedded here, and give the other to the person I'm cooking with. But I take the chicken butt for myself. I could never understand why my brothers always fought over that triangular tip \u2014 until one day I got the crispy, juicy fat myself. These are the cook's rewards. Cut the breast down the middle and serve it on the bone, with one wing joint still attached to each. The preparation is not meant to be superelegant. Slather the meat with fresh butter. Serve with mustard on the side (Which I don't feel necessary as the chicken turned out to be quite flavorful) and, if you wish, a simple green salad. You'll start using a knife and fork, but finish with your fingers, because it's so good."}

{"cook_time": "20 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "While all of us surely love our lobster ravioli, truffle oil, shavings of truffles encased in sheets of freshly made pasta, foie terrines, and other fussy dishes, sometimes it's hard to beat a well made, silken, custardy carbonara. The problem is, many restaurants don't seem to be able to put out a halfway decent one! Either the noodles are overcooked, the bacon's too salty, or the eggs have scrambled. Which means that whenever I want this, I tend to make it on my own. So I'm lucky that it's so ridiculously simple to make.\r\n\r\nThe basic \"formula\" for this is 100g of dried pasta, 1 egg yolk, 50mils of cream, and 20-30g of parmesan. And while the meat in question is usually thickly sliced bacon lardons, I'm using some chorizo here that I got from a recent trip to Barcelona, which is an intensely smoky, flavourful and fragrant dry cured sausage, to give it a slightly Spanish twist. What I love about chorizo is that the smoked paprika used in seasoning the sausage bleeds red into the oil that's rendered out as you heat it, which in turn imparts a deep orange hue to the sauce. Of course, if you don't have chorizo, bacon will do great (that's the classic way after all), otherwise another twist I love is using meatballs made from sausagemeat (a herby, garlicky one works best for me) which you saut\u00e9 with the bacon until its fully cooked before adding the noodles in.\r\n\r\nI hope you try it and love it as much as I do, 'cos that'll mean you never have to face another sad restaurant-style excuse of a carbonara again.

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat and gently fry the chorizo to render out some oil and heat it through, giving the pan a couple of good tosses.\r\nCook the pasta until it's just al dente.\r\nWhile the pasta is cooking, whisk together the cream, egg yolks, and parmesan. Season this mix well with pepper, but leave the salting till later - the parmesan and sausages are both salty, so it's best to correct the seasoning at the end.\r\nWhen the pasta is al dente, drain it and add it to the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat, then pour in the egg mix, tossing carefully so each noodle is coated in the sauce. The residual heat from the pan and the noodles will cook the eggs but shouldn't make them curdle. Taste, correct the seasoning if necessary, then serve immediately with extra parmesan on the side and sprinkled with parsley if desired."}

{"cook_time": "10 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "I'm crazy about dumplings of any kind, and one of my favourite things to do on a rainy weekend is to make a whole bunch of dumplings of various flavours.  They freeze extremely well and after a relaxing afternoon of dumpling making, you have a well stocked freezer and the security of knowing that for the next few months you are just minutes away from a delicious homemade dumpling feast at any time.  Dumpling Day should be a national holiday.\r\n\r\nThe secret to a good dumpling is the texture of the filling.  The filling should be firm, consistent and springy.  Too many homemade dumplings suffer from fillings that are separate and grainy, and which do not offer sufficient resistance to the teeth.  To make a delicious, springy dumpling we need to look at a chemical process called thermogelling.  In a nutshell, muscle fibres in meat and fish contain myofibrillary proteins known as actin and myosin.  In solution, these proteins form a gel which, when heated, traps water, fat and starch creating a springy and tender texture.  Creating a strong gel depends on a number of factors, including the concentration of these proteins, the temperature of the solution, its acidity and its salt content.\r\n\r\nSo how does this translate to Dumpling Day? It's all about creating the right environment for the formation of the gel, and ensuring that your filling has the right amount of water, fat and starch to create the right texture.", "title": "Dumpling Day", "ingredients": ["Basic Filling Mixture", "Minced Pork", "Onion (or spring/green onion)", "Minced Garlic", "Grated Ginger", "Salt", "White Pepper", "White Vinegar", "Shaoxing Wine", "Soy sauce", "Cornstarch", "Dumpling Wrappers", "Premade wrappers are fine, but if you want to make your own it is not too hard.\u00a0 When buying premade wrappers, Gowgee, Jiaozi and Gyoza all refer to the same thing, but they are just the Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese pronunciations respectively.\u00a0 Wonton skins could also be used, depending on the type of dumpling you're trying to make.", "Flavourings", "Chinese Cabbage", "Prawns", "Shiso (Perilla)", "Nira", "Or anything else you like"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/dumpling-day", "prep_time": "60 Min", "method": "First, we need start in the morning with a basic pork mixture.  Take minced pork (I used about 1.5 kilos of medium fatty mince and ended up with more than 100 dumplings).  If you feel so inclined, you could run the meat through a mincer once or twice more to make sure it is very well minced.  The fattier the mince the more tender the filling will be, but if the mince is too fatty then there will not be enough actual meat (muscle) to release its myosin for creating the gel that gives the filling the right springiness.  Add to the meat some white vinegar (4 tbsp), shaoxing wine (2 tbsp), salt, white pepper, soy sauce (2 tbsp) and cornstarch (2 tbsp).  In a small food processor (or you could just finely chop everything together) I pureed half a large onion (you could finely chop a small bunch of spring onion instead), 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and 5cms of grated ginger and added it to the pork.  Using your hands, mix everything together and knead the mixture very firmly for about 20 minutes.  The kneading process is vital, as it releases the myofibrillary protein from its muscular organisation and allows the creation of the gelatinized network that gives you a springy filling.  Set this aside in the fridge while you prepare your flavourings.\n\r\nOf course, you can just make plain dumplings, but I like to have a bit of variety.  Any kind of additional flavouring is fine.  Today, I made separate batches with prawn, shiso (perilla), nira (I think this is called 'chinese chives' in the west), and Hakusai ('bai cai' or 'chinese cabbage'').  You could also use shiitake, chili, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, coriander, pea shoots... anything really.\n\r\n Finely chop the prawns, almost to a puree.  I used a food processor.  Roughly chop the chinese cabbage and boil in salted water for around 5 minutes.  Drain, transfer to a  board and very finely chop.  Then places the mixture in a clean tea towel and squeeze out all the remaining liquid.  For the nira, I chopped it to around 2 cms in length, boiled for 2-3 minutes and again squeezed out all the moisture.  The shiso doesn't need to be pre-cooked and you can just slice this very finely.  To do this, halve a stack of leaves along the rib, roll up each stack of halves (lengthways) and very finely julienne.\n\r\nSeparate your flavourings into separate bowls and add to them the basic pork mixture.  Now take turns with each flavouring, transferring it to your big mixing bowl and kneading until the flavourings are all combined and the mixture becomes springy - around 5 minutes for each batch.  Transfer all your bowls of mixture to the fridge and let it rest for a few hours to allow the gel network to form.  The saltiness of the mixture and the acidity of the vinegar provide a suitable environment for this process.  With the prawns, you have added additional myosin from the prawn meat, so you may notice this mixture becoming very springy, almost to the point of being 'bouncy'.\n\r\nAfter a few hours it's time to make your dumplings.  I won't go into dumpling folding methods (maybe another time), but you can make wontons, jiaozi, pleated gyoza or simple dumplings for boiling... whatever takes your fancy.  For me, I usually make these dumplings in broth so I use a very simple fold that looks fine in soup or boiled.  If you wanted to make dumplings for frying (like gyoza) or steaming (like xiaolongbao/shourumpo), then you may prefer a slightly more attractive shape.  You can even just leave them as half moons, like some Japanese or Korean dumplings.\n\r\nMy method is to take a gyoza wrapper, place about a teaspoon of dumpling filling in the centre.  Dip your finger in a bowl of water and wet the top half edge of the wrapper and fold the bottom half up into a half-moon shape, making sure that the filling is centred, and that there is no air trapped in the wrapper.  Then wet the very top of the half-moon and fold each end up to the centre.  Store on a tray (making sure they don't touch each other) and then when each batch is finished, transfer the tray to the freezer.\n\r\nWhen they're well frozen, transfer each batch to a large ziplock bag marked with the corresponding flavour and continue to store in the freezer.\n\r\nTo cook, you can boil the frozen dumplings in salted water or stock for about 10 minutes, or steam them for about 12-15, or even fry them (as for gyoza) or deep fry them.  Bear in mind though that the difference between these and commercially frozen dumplings (aside from tasting much better and not containing any of the chemical additives) is that firstly, they don't contain preservatives so they will not last as long in the freezer and secondly, the filling is not pre-cooked, so you need to make sure they are cooked all the way through.\n\r\nPersonally, I usually steam or boil them for a snack served with some chili oil and black vinegar, or add them to broth for a dumpling soup breakfast.  There's nothing quite like a homemade dumpling, so set aside a day of your weekend for the mental therapy of Dumpling Day."}

Discard the seeds and stems and toss the chiles in a food processor along with all the other ingredients.\n\r\nTake the roast out of the freezer and orient the roast how you\u2019d have it sitting in the roasting pan (fat side up). The idea here is that you want to slice the meat into 3/4? thick slices that will stack on top of each other in the roasting pan.

If you\u2019re using canned pineapple let it marinate overnight as most of the enzyme is destroyed in the canning process.\n\r\nWhen the roast is ready to go in the oven, set the oven to 450 degrees F. Put the roast on a rack in a roasting pan and add water to the bottom of the pan (this is to keep the drippings from smoking).

Evenly distribute the drained strawberries over the cream.

Probably because even though it is a simple recipe it has some tricky bits you have to handle carefully:\r\n\r\nGetting old enough potatoes. In most countries the only potatoes you can buy are young potatoes, while this recipe asks for older potatoes that can get golden when fried.\r\nBoiling and frying at the same time. While olive oil doesn't work well at high temperatures like peanut oil, it has a usually forgotten quality: it can boil at the same time it fries whatever you put in it. That is if you set the fire at that sweet spot, not too high, not too low. This allows the potatoes to both boil and fry.\r\nNot overcooking the eggs. It is fairly easy to let yourself go and fearing that the omelette might break you allow the eggs to form a thick, compact shape. But, as in its french counterpart, the beauty of the potato omelette happens when the insides are moist and almost difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nThere are different recipes in every town, and probably in every bar in Spain.

You want at least a centimeter of depth that spreads around the whole surface of the pan. set the heat to a bit above medium\r\nchop the onion in little bits and add it to the pan. make sure the heat is properly set by looking at the onions: they have to look as if they are being both fried and boiled at the same time\r\nadd the potatoes to the pan when the onions start to be slightly golden\r\nnow is a good time to check if there is enough oil in the pan: all the potatoes should be touching a bit of oil, but they shouldn't be drenched or submerged in it\r\nleave the heat at medium and cover the pan so the potatoes and the onion boil and fry at the same time\r\nstir the mix everynow and then so every piece of potato releases its water and gets covered by the oil\r\nnow is a good time to add salt at your discrection\r\nput the eggs in a bowl big enough to hold both the eggs and the potatoes and mix them thoroughly with a fork\r\nwhen the potatoes are boiled/fried put the oil from the pan aside and mix the potatoes with the eggs in the big bowl.

Do it in a smooth and quickly fashion. You want the omelette to be now on the plate, with the top side cooked and the bottom side uncooked\r\nput the pan back on the fire and slide the omelette back into it, so the bottom uncooked side is in contact with the pan\r\ncook for another minute or so, shaking the pan and slide the omelette onto a plate\r\nlet it cool off for a few minutes.

{"cook_time": "60 Min", "portions": "4", "description": "Everything to do with how good your food tastes depends on the quality of everything that you put into it. Stocks are one of the most basic building blocks, so I figured it made sense to put some of my favourites here, i.e. chicken stock, vegetable stock and prawn stock. All of these stocks require such different treatment, which is why I've chosen them. For example, the chicken takes a couple of hours of cooking for all the flavour to fully be extracted, whereas the prawns take slightly less, and the flavour of the vegetable stock is actually detracted from if you cook it too long.\r\n\r\nChicken stock is a great meat-based stock that is really light in flavour, and is great as a braising liquid as it readily takes on the flavours of the ingredients cooked in it. Vegetable stock is a great all-purpose liquid for cooking (from making sauces to deglazing pans to hydrating pasta, to making any number of soups), so I always have a bottle handy in my fridge (and another in my freezer for when the one in my fridge runs out). Prawn stock is a little more specialised, but I love making prawn noodle soup (where use the diluted prawn stock to simmer pork soup bones before cooking egg noodles and fresh prawns in them), or even using it to add an extra kick to prawn pastas.\r\n\r\nI add chicken feet to my chicken stock as there is a tonne of collagen in the feet, which gives the stock a gelatinous quality without having to reduce it. If you can't find them, then just go without. The other favourite of mine is veal stock, but I think that really deserves a post on its own, so when I make a new batch of that, I'll give you guys a heads up. :)", "title": "Stocks", "ingredients": ["Chicken Stock:", "2 kg chicken necks, backs, wings and bones", "500g chicken feet", "2 large carrots", "2 large leeks (white and light green parts only)", "2 large brown onions", "1 bay leaf", "1 tbsp white peppercorns", "1 big bowl of ice cubes", "Prawn Stock:", "1 kg prawn heads and shells", "2 large brown onions, peeled and cut into 1cm", "mirepoix", "1 small carrot, peeled and cut into 1cm", "mirepoix:", "olive oil", "Vegetable Stock", "3 large carrots, peeled", "4 large brown onions, peeled", "4 large leeks, white and light green parts only", "1 head of fennel", "2 parsnips, peeled", "1 tbsp olive oil", "1 bay leaf", "mixture of fresh herbs (I like using either tarragon or thyme, or you can omit this completely)"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/stocks", "prep_time": "25 Min", "method": "Chicken Stock\r\nRinse the chicken bones and feet well to remove any visible blood and any internal organs still attached. Blood proteins coagulate when heated and this will cause your stock to become cloudy. Cut the bones into 3-inch pieces.\r\nPlace the bones in a large stock pot, and fill with enough cold water to cover the bones by about 2 inches. Place over low heat, and bring to the boil slowly. It normally takes about an hour for my stock to come to a boil, so give it time. If you try to heat it too vigourously, it will end up emulsifying the impurities into the soup. Heat it gently, and skim constantly.\r\nWhile waiting for the soup to come to a boil, peel and chop the vegetables into 1-inch mirepoix. A stock is not a rubbish bin that you dump odds and ends into, so peel your carrots. That's right. PEEL THEM.\r\nOnce the liquid starts to come to a simmer, do as much straining as you can. This is when some of the impurities start to get dislodged, so really get all that gunk out. After about 5 minutes of heavy-duty skimming, add in the ice cubes and skim out the fat that coagulates on the surface. I must stress again that you should skim as much as possible, because once you add the aromatics and vegetables in, it'll be a lot harder to.\r\nAdd the vegetables and aromatics in, and bring the stock back to a simmer. Let it simmer gently, skimming where possible (I usually give up after this), for another hour. Turn off the heat, then let it rest for 15 minutes, as this will allow the particles to settle at the bottom of the pot.\r\nLine a fine grained sieve with muslin, and set it over another medium-sized pot, which you then place in an ice bath. Ladle the stock out through the sieve into the pot. Do NOT pour the stock out, as this will force the impurities through, and do not press down on the residue that collects in the muslin. Allow the stock to cool in the ice bath until it reaches room temperature, then cover, label, and refrigerate overnight. The layer of fat which has solidified on the top can now be removed easily.\r\nIf using within 3 days, store in an airtight container in the fridge. Otherwise, either freeze as is, or reduce to 1/4 the volume and freeze in ice cube trays, rehydrating with 3x the volume of each cube of water when thawing to save space.\n\n\r\nPrawn Stock\r\nPlace the onions and carrots with 1 tbsp of olive oil in a medium-sized pot. Saut\u00e9 over gentle heat until the onions are translucent (don't let them colour) and the carrots are slightly softened. Remove from heat and set aside.\r\nIn a hot saut\u00e9 pan, saut\u00e9 the prawn heads and shells (in batches if necessary) in olive oil until bright orange and cooked through. They should be really fragrant. Add the cooked heads and shells into the pot with the onions and carrots. Repeat until all the shells are cooked.\r\nAdd enough cold water to cover the heads and shells by about 1cm, and place over low heat. Slowly bring it to a simmer, skimming off the impurities and foam that rise to the top, and allow to simmer for 45min. The stock should have taken on the colour of the shells.\r\nRemove from the heat, and pour everything (in batches, if necessary), into a blender. Process, then strain into a metal bowl or container set in an ice bath, pressing down on the shells with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all the juices. Allow to cool completely, then cover and refrigerate for 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month.\n\n\r\nVegetable Stock\r\nFinely chop all the vegetables (you can use a food processor if possible). Fry it in olive oil in a stock pot on low heat until the vegetables are all softened and fragrant, but have not coloured (5 minutes or so). Add in the bay leaf and whatever fresh herbs if you're using any, then fill the stockpot with cold water (enough to cover the vegetables by 2 inches).\r\nSlowly bring it to a simmer, then simmer for 35 minutes, skimming any impurities off the surface. When the cooking time is up, remove from the heat and let it stand for 15 minutes to allow the particles to settle.\r\nLine a fine grained sieve with muslin and set it over another pot which has been placed in an ice bath. Ladle the stock through the sieve, allow to cool completely, then refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months. (This stock can also be reduced further and frozen as ice cubes.)"}

Start by making the batter.  Sift together about a cup of flour (more if a large amount of batter is needed), a heaped teaspoon of turmeric, a pinch of asfoetida powder (or about a teaspoon of garlic powder), salt and white pepper.  Remove about two tablespoons of the flour mixture and reserve.  Whisk in the beer until you get a thick batter consistency.  Set aside for up to an hour to thicken and to let the turmeric colour develop.\n\r\n2.  To make the tartare sauce (you can make this in advance) finely chop a shallot, two tablespoons of gherkins, a teaspoon of capers , the rind of three preserved lemon quarters and around two tablespoons of fresh parsley. Mix together with about three quarters of a cup of mayonnaise.\n\r\n3.  Peel and cut your potatoes into chips.  You don't want french fries so don't cut them too thin.  Soak in some water to take away some of the starch and then dry on a tea towel.  Getting the chips dry is the secret to a crispy chip.\n\r\n4.  Peel your prawns, leaving the tails intact (if using) and skin and dry your fish).  I cut some deep diagonal cuts in the legs side of the prawns because I didn't want them to curl too much when frying. The prep is done so wash up and get ready to deep fry.\n\r\n5.  Heat your oil to around medium high.  You don't want it too hot or everything will brown before it is cooked.\n\r\n6.  Start with the chips, as you don't want pieces of burnt batter floating around amongst your chips.  Deep fry until the chips are done and turn a light golden brown.  Drain on some newspaper and toss with lots of salt and a little pepper.\n\r\n7.  Dredge the prawns and fish in your reserved flour and, dip in the batter and deep fry until cooked through.  The batter should turn a beautiful golden colour from the turmeric and the cooking.  You don't want it to be too brown.  Drain on more newspaper and season again.\n\r\n8.  Serve immediately with the preserved lemon tartare sauce.\n\r\nI just had this for lunch and it did wonders for my hangover.  I would normally have had a beer with this, but I didn't think I could handle it at that exact moment..."}

It's an interesting combination - and it was quite delightful how when you put the crisply fried gyoza dipped in the wine-coloured ponzu into your mouth, you taste pomegranate for the first couple of seconds which then give way to the more robust flavours of chilli, shrimp and chive.  Quite yummy.", "title": "Shrimp Gyoza & Pomegranate Ponzu", "ingredients": ["**The Gyoza**", "- raw shrimp, peeled and deveined (if necessary)", "- Chinese Chives / Nira", "- garlic", "- ginger", "- sesame oil", "- rice wine", "- tiny bit of salt", "- egg white", "- gyoza skins", "**The Ponzu (dipping sauce)**", "- pomegranate seeds", "- lemon juice", "- sesame oil", "- chilli oil"], "difficulty": "medium", "link": "http://www.halfhourmeals.com/recipe/shrimp-gyoza-pomegranate-ponzu", "prep_time": "5 Min", "method": "**The Ponzu**\n\r\nWe'll make the sauce first so we can set it aside.  For when the gyoza are done.\n\r\n1. Put your pomegranate seeds into a blender and strain the juice into a bowl.  \n\r\n2. Mix in a dash of lemon juice, a touch of sesame oil and a drizzle of chilli oil.  Taste it - it should be quite tart, with a little sweetness.  Some chopped coriander or mint would also be great in this, I think.\n\r\n**The Gyoza**\n\r\nThe only difficult thing about making gyoza is the actual wrapping of the skins.  For that, rather than try to cumbersomely describe the process in words, I made a video which is linked below.\n\r\n1. Roughly chop your shrimp and add to a big mixing bowl.  Finely chop the chives and throw them in.  Mince some garlic and ginger - only a small amount is required, really the gyoza should taste of shrimp and chive, not of garlic - and add it to the bowl.  Add a touch of sesame oil, about the same amount of rice wine and a tiny grinding of salt.  Mix thoroughly and add an egg white to bind.\n\r\n2. Grab your gyoza skins and make gyoza!  To see how this is done, please watch my Youtube video on [How To Make Gyoza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spsGbDWauf4) :)\n\r\n3. As I mention in the video, keep your gyoza somewhere cool before you cook them.  Ideally, put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes beforehand.  This will help the skins to stiffen so they don't become inflated, gelatinous blobs during cooking.\n\r\n**Cooking The Gyoza**\n\r\nEveryone has a different method for cooking gyoza - fry first boil last, boil first fry last yadda yadda - here is my method which is a foolproof way of getting satisfyingly crispy bottoms as well as pleasantly steamed tops.  It's a boil first first fry last method.\n\r\n1.  Heat about a centimeter of water in a flat-bottomed wok (or any pan you have with a lid).\n\r\n2. When the water is at a rolling boil, gently lay your gyoza in rows.  Laying them in rows makes it easier to remove them later (just scoop them up in rows).  Cover, allowing space for escaping steam, and let boil for a few minutes.\n\r\n3. Uncover.  There will still be some water left at this point.  Let it all boil down and watch the pan carefully.  When it begins to go all frothy and dry, add some oil to the pan (there may still be a tiny bit of water in the pan but that's ok).  Tilt the pan so that the oil covers all edges of the gyoza.  It's safe to tilt the pan as the gyoza will most likely be stuck completely to it.\n\r\n4. Let the gyoza fry for 4 -5 minutes on a medium heat.  Absolutely do not touch the gyoza at all - they will not be ready to be released from the pan until the very end of the cooking process.  You will need use your spidey sense a bit and carefully watch the bottom fringes of your gyoza to give you an idea of how brown the undersides are - careful not to burn them.\n\r\n5. When you think the bottoms have browned enough, turn off the heat.  Grab a flat spatula and scoop the gyoza up off the pan in rows.  Eat them fresh from the pan, dipped in the ponzu, all crispy and succulent :)"}
