First i thought.. damn... looks very difficult. Never done something like this before... and the whole recipe in english.. *wooops*. But ya.. i thought go on and try it! Posting date is today. i started yesterday with making the dough. Refrigerated over night and made the apple-cinnamon filling today! The whole hours i worked with it... it's worth! i love this and will definitely make it with some other fillings like spinach, berries or cocos.. </span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">DANISH DOUGH</span></span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">1. Combine yeast and milk in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed.<br>2. Slowly add sugar, orange zest, cardamom, vanilla extract, vanilla seeds, eggs, and orange juice. Mix well.<br>3. Change to the dough hook and add the salt with the flour, 1 cup at a time, increasing speed to medium as the flour is incorporated.<br>4. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until smooth. You may need to add a little more flour if it is sticky.<br>5. Transfer dough to a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap.<br>6. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br><br>BUTTER BLOCK<br>1. Combine butter and flour in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute.<br>2. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle and then beat for 1 minute more, or until smooth and lump free.<br>3. Set aside at room temperature.<br>4. After the detrempe has chilled 30 minutes, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle approximately 18 x 13 inches and \u00bc inch thick. The dough may be sticky, so keep dusting it lightly with flour.<br>5. Spread the butter evenly over the center and right thirds of the dough.<br>6. Fold the left edge of the detrempe to the right, covering half of the butter. Fold the right third of the rectangle over the center third. The first turn has now been completed. Mark the dough by poking it with your finger to keep track of your turns, or use a sticky and keep a tally. Place the dough on a baking sheet, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br>7. Place the dough lengthwise on a floured work surface. The open ends should be to your right and left. Roll the dough into another approximately 13 x 18 inch, \u00bc-inch-thick rectangle. Again, fold the left third of the rectangle over the center third and the right third over the center third. No additional butter will be added as it is already in the dough. The second turn has now been completed. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.<br>8. Roll out, turn, and refrigerate the dough two more times, for a total of four single turns. Make sure you are keeping track of your turns. Refrigerate the dough after the final turn for at least 5 hours or overnight. The Danish dough is now ready to be used.If you will not be using the dough within 24 hours, freeze it. To do this, roll the dough out to about 1 inch in thickness, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and freeze. Defrost the dough slowly in the refrigerator for easiest handling. Danish dough will keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.</span><br></span></span><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><br>APPLE FILLING</span><br><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">1. Toss all ingredients except butter in a large bowl.<br>2. Melt the butter in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat until slightly nutty in color, about 6 - 8 minutes. 3. Then add the apple mixture and saut\u00e9 until apples are softened and caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes.<br>4. If you\u2019ve chosen Fujis, the apples will be caramelized, but have still retained their shape. Pour the cooked apples onto a baking sheet to cool completely before forming the braid.<br>5. (If making ahead, cool to room temperature, seal, and refrigerate.) They will cool faster when spread in a thin layer over the surface of the sheet. After they have cooled, the filling can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Left over filling can be used as an ice cream topping, for muffins, cheesecake, or other pastries.</span><br></span></span><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;font-family:verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><br>DANISH BRAID</span><br><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">1. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll the Danish Dough into a 15 x 20-inch rectangle, \u00bc inch thick. If the dough seems elastic and shrinks back when rolled, let it rest for a few minutes, then roll again. Place the dough on the baking sheet.<br>2. Along one long side of the pastry make parallel, 5-inch-long cuts with a knife or rolling pastry wheel, each about 1 inch apart. Repeat on the opposite side, making sure to line up the cuts with those you\u2019ve already made.<br>3. Spoon the filling you\u2019ve chosen to fill your braid down the center of the rectangle. Starting with the top and bottom \u201cflaps\u201d, fold the top flap down over the filling to cover. Next, fold the bottom \u201cflap\u201d up to cover filling. This helps keep the braid neat and helps to hold in the filling. Now begin folding the cut side strips of dough over the filling, alternating first left, then right, left, right, until finished. Trim any excess dough and tuck in the ends.Egg WashWhisk together the whole egg and yolk in a bowl and with a pastry brush, lightly coat the braid.<br><br></span><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">Proofing and Baking<br>1. cSpray cooking oil (Pam\u2026) onto a piece of plastic wrap, and place over the braid. Proof at room temperature or, if possible, in a controlled 90 degree F environment for about 2 hours, or until doubled in volume and light to the touch.<br>2. Near the end of proofing, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Position a rack in the center of the oven.<br>3. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the pan so that the side of the braid previously in the back of the oven is now in the front. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and bake about 15-20 minutes more, or until golden brown. Cool and serve the braid either still warm from the oven or at room temperature. The cooled braid can be wrapped airtight and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, or freeze for 1 month.<br><br>Glaze<br>1.

In the end, the appeal of truffled mash kind of won out, and since the best mash (if I don't get crucified for calling Jo\u00ebl Robuchon's pommes pur\u00e9e a \"mash\") I ever had was at one of his l'ateliers anyway, we put as much fat as we could bear to into the potatoes since his ideal ratio is well, equal parts of potato to butter.<br><br>Jokes aside, mashed potatoes are one of THE most satisfying (side) dishes on the face of the earth. They are ridiculously easy to make, and oh god the pleasure of licking the extra potato off the wooden spoon........<br><br>The only point of contention I know about regarding potatoes is that the general view is that one should only boil the potatoes IN their skin, as this preserves the nutrients better (or something like that). And while this\u00a0is\u00a0found to have some truth in it according to the pile of food science books I've recently finished reading, I personally don't eat mashed potatoes for their nutritional content, and anyway smaller pieces cook faster. :P (Serves 6)<br><br><ol><li>Boil the potatoes until fork tender (yes, I go past the knife-being-inserted-with-no-resistance bit), whichever way you like - i.e. skin on or off, starting with cold water or hot, but whatever the case, PLEASE SALT YOUR WATER GENEROUSLY.</li><li>When the potatoes are cooked through and on the verge of falling apart, drain the water from the pot, then return the pan to very low heat for a minute or two to steam the potatoes dry.</li><li>Use a food mill or a potato ricer (NEVER USE A FOOD PROCESSOR OR BLENDER AS THIS WILL TURN YOUR POTATOES GLUEY!) and pass the potatoes into an appropriately sized mixing bowl - I like using one with at least the capacity for at least twice the amount of potatoes I have. If you don't own a food mill nor potato ricer, just use the back of a wooden spoon to mash it in the bowl.</li><li>Once the potatoes are mashed, add all of the butter, spreading it out. Fold the butter into the hot potatoes so it melts and is evenly distributed. Add the truffle oil and gently stir it through. Season now with salt (I prefer not to use white pepper as I want the truffle flavour to come through pretty cleanly, but go ahead if you want), then add the milk and beat it through quickly. It should turn into a silken, voluptuous cloud of heaven right about now.</li><li>Serve immediately!

We've often eaten Spaghettis alla Carbonara (cream, egg, bacon or ham) but did you know that the REAL way to make carbonara in Italy is actually WITHOUT cream?<br>The caloric benefit is obvious and if absolutely cannot have your Carbonara without cream? you can always pour the non fat version but still, you should once in your life try a real Italian Carbonara :)<br>First, cook your spaghettis the way you usually do, al dente, with bit of salt. While it's cooking, break an egg and batter it to have a smooth yellow liquid.\u00a0<br>When the spaghettis are done, empty the water and put them aside. Take a pan and start cooking the bacon cut in little pieces. You COULD use ham but then you might need to add salt. The reason bacon works so much better is because it replaces salt (and god know how much salt we already eat daily...)<br>While the bacon is cooking, pour the egg in the spaghettis and add some parmesan cheese. Mix everything.<br>When the bacon is ready, get rid of the excess oil and place place them on the spaghettis. When everything is mixed, have the entire thing on a plate and add some rocket salad for the colour and the vegetable.<br>Important: because the egg is put raw in the spaghetti, it is more than important to have it very fresh! It does cook with the heat of the spaghettis but still.<br>Have yourself a glass of red wine and enjoy ^_^                ", "title": "Carbonara perfetto Recipe"}

With this dish though, the chili really turns on the flavour. \u00a0Anyone who tries it admits that the hotter it gets, the more tasty it is. \u00a0For that reason, when I make this I make it as hot as I can. \u00a0It hurts, but it hurts good.<br><br>Now for the method...<br><br>First joint the chicken and cut into small pieces. Choose an older chicken if you can, as the flavour is much better and the toughness of older birds really suits the dish. \u00a0Of course, you can use simple breast meat or thigh meat as well, but personally I like to cook this on the bone. \u00a0With meat only it tends to be a little soft in my opinion. \u00a0To joint the chicken I take off the wings and drumsticks (halving the drumsticks) and then take the whole chicken in half, discarding the neck, spine and bum. \u00a0Then I halve each half again to a breast portion and thigh portion before chopping each to pieces about the same size as the wings. \u00a0Sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I don't really know the butchery terms. \u00a0\u00a0Then marinade the chicken pieces in the chicken marinade ingredients for at least 1/2 an hour.<br><br>While the chicken is marinading, make the sauce. \u00a0There's quite a lot of ingredients but the method is simple - just blend it all together. \u00a0Korean chili powder is not particularly hot, so the main source of heat is in the fresh chilies that you add. \u00a0As I said, I like this to be really hot and so I generally use about 5 really hot small chilies. \u00a0If you don't think you can stand the heat, you can use less either in number or intensity, but I do recommend bumping the spiciness up above what you're used to. \u00a0This is Fire Chicken after all.<br><br>To cook everything, take a large frypan and start the chicken pieces over medium heat. \u00a0The chicken will blacken quickly as the sugar and honey caramelise but don't get concerned; this really adds to the flavour. \u00a0Reduce the heat a little and cook for about 10 minutes until the chicken is maybe two thirds done. \u00a0Then add in the sauce, stir it together and cook a further 5 minutes. \u00a0The sauce will darken to the deep red you see in the picture. \u00a0When it's all finished transfer everything to a plate and scatter the chicken with some chopped spring onion, sesame seeds or - my preference as in the picture - a good amount of aonori.<br><br>Serve this with some simple pickled daikon (cubed pieces of daikon pickled in a simple brine of salt, sugar, white vinegar and water) and a kind of coleslaw (shredded cabbage and onion shaved on a mandolin, with a big dollop of mayonnaise swirled with kochujan. \u00a0I'd suggest going to the extra effort to make these traditional accompaniments, as they match with the chicken perfectly. \u00a0Also, you're going to need them to cool down your mouth if you've made the chicken as spicy as you should.<br><br>The easiest way to eat this off the bone is with 2 forks that you can use to tear away the meat. \u00a0I prefer this as the sauce makes eating this with fingers a pretty messy prospect.<br><br>What I really like about this dish is that it goes superbly with booze. \u00a0Chamisul is a great match and really helps cool down your mouth. \u00a0Beer also goes really well and so if you're anything like me, go for both.<br><br>I think this would also make a great BBQ dish, maybe just using drumsticks. \u00a0To do that I would cook the sauce separately for about 10 minutes or so and marinade the chicken before leaving. \u00a0Then the chicken could be done on the BBQ and then mixed with the sauce in a large aluminium foil packet and then baked right on the BBQ top. \u00a0I'm definitely going to try doing that next time I go to a BBQ.

There\u2019s nothing more amazing then biting into a hefty chunk of belly, with the fat melting in your mouth and the meat exploding with flavour. Done right, it can be beautifully sinfully delicious.</p><p>\u201cSinful\u201d is the operative word here. So I thought I could \u201chealthy\u201d things up a bit by having it as a salad (although with the amount of fat intact and the oil-rich dressing, it may not quite be the best thing to eat when you\u2019re on a diet). It\u2019s easy to make and quite fuss free; just marinate, roast, then slice it up and toss with the salad.</p><p>One important thing to note about pork belly is that you should try to choose one that has a relatively equal distribution of fat and meat. Too much fat and it becomes a bit too much porkgasm overload; too much meat and there may not be enough fat to keep it moist and tasty.</p><p>Visit my food blog ChinChaiChef for more recipes!</p><p>1. Trim the skin and topmost layer of fat off the pork belly.</p><p>2. Mix the soya sauces, honey and garlic, and pour into a Ziploc bag. Put the belly strip into the bag, rezip it, and massage the marinade into the pork. Leave for 30 minutes on the counter while you go and do your own thang.</p><p>3. Preheat oven to 180 degrees. Lightly oil the base of a roasting pan so that the pork belly won't stick to it. Put the belly strip into the pan, with a tablespoon of the marinade drizzled over it. Cover with tinfoil and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes.</p><p>4. Uncover the roasting pan, and roast one side of the belly under high heat for 5 minutes. Then flip it over and roast the other side for 5 minutes.</p><p>5. Remove from oven and let the meat rest for about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, wash and spin the salad. Then start slicing up the meat in 1 inch-thick slices. Set aside.</p><p>6. Hold up the pan on one end so that the juices collect in the other, and lightly beat with a fork so that the oil and meat juices are mixed well. Drizzle as much as you want over salad, then toss.</p><p>7. Plate salad, dressed with sprinkled nuts and about 5 slices of pork belly per plate.

Give it a stir and let it sit while you prepare the dry ingredients. Put all dry ingredients (don\u2019t forget the remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar) in a mixing bowl , or preferably in a bowl of a stand mixer if you have one and use the hook attachment. Use a whisk or fork to thoroughly blend all the dry ingredients together.\u00a0Once yeast has set for about 10 minutes, or until foamy, add olive oil into the yeast mixture. Next, start the mixer, or start stirring while adding small amounts of the liquids (yeast mixture) into the dry ingredients at a time. Do not add the liquid in all at once or else you may end up with a dough that is too wet; do not add more liquid until all the yeast mixture is thoroughly incorporated. Add or exclude some water/yeast mixture as needed. The dough should not be sticky, and not too dry and dense. Now, kneed the dough for about eight minutes, until it becomes more elastic. Then, oil a large bowl, and put the ball of dough in it to proof. Make sure the dough is completely coated with a layer of oil, then cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for at least two hours.</span></p> <p><br></p> <p><span style=\"letter-spacing:0px;\">Preheat the oven to 500\u00baF (260\u00baC)\u2014and yes, it needs to be that hot. If you have a pizza stone (highly suggested if you want a crispier crust) place it in the oven\u2019s center rack before you preheat it. If you do not have a pizza stone, a cookie sheet, or any other edgeless pan, and parchment paper will do. Do not preheat oven with cookie sheet in it. Now is a good time to prepare and lay out your toppings; have your basil ready, slice the mozzarella into about quarter inch slices (half centimeter), and have your crushed tomatoes ready.</span></p> <p><br></p> <p><span style=\"letter-spacing:0px;\">Next, take the risen dough and press with your knuckles on a lightly floured board or countertop to evenly distribute the gas bubbles within the dough. Separate the dough into 4 even sections. Take one section and form it into a round disk about 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm). Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough until it reaches a diameter of about 8-10 inches (20 to 25 cm). Obviously, the larger the diameter, the thinner the crust, so do as you like. The easiest way to ensure a round-as-possible crust is to turn the dough 1/8 of a turn each time you go over it with your rolling pin. Once you have the dough rolled out to your desired thickness, transfer to a piece of parchment paper on a cookie sheet, or if you\u2019re using a pizza stone, on a pizza board sprinkled with a little corn meal. This allows the pizza to easily slide off the board and onto the pizza stone. Now the fun part. Put a thin layer of crushed tomato (2-3 tablespoons per pizza is enough) on the crust, but leave about a 1 inch (2 cm) boarder without tomato around the perimeter. Then, put a layer of basil leaves on top of the crushed tomato, and top that with the mozzarella. Remember that the cheese will melt and spread out, so keep the slices closer to the center of the pizza, and don\u2019t overdo it. It\u2019s a good idea to prepare all the pizzas you're going to bake before you start baking the first one.</span></p><p><br></p> <p><span style=\"letter-spacing:0px;\">Finally, bake for exactly 6-8 minutes per pizza. It is crucial that you keep an eye on your pizza while it bakes. It can go from perfectly golden brown to perfectly burnt to a crisp within a minute. Check on your pizza after about 4 or 5 minutes. The crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should have melted. During the remaining 1-3 minutes, the cheese will brown. After the cheese starts to turn brown in some areas, take the pizza out. Slide the pizza, off the pan or pizza board and onto a cutting board, and let cool for a few minutes before cutting. Drizzle with olive oil and a grind of black pepper before serving (optional, of course).</span></p><span style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue';font-size:11px;\"><br></span><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"letter-spacing:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">variations:</span></span></p><ul><li>toppings! add whatever toppings you\u2019d like. just remember that anything meat must be pre-cooked. some veggies should be saut\u00e9ed before hand as well.<br></li><li>use different cheeses<br></li><li>make an oval shaped pizza for a rustic look<br></li><li>substitute up to half of the flour used with whole wheat flour<br></li></ul><br><br>                ", "title": "thin crust margarita pizza from scratch Recipe"}

t</span>he taste of battery<span>-</span>farmed birds is so weak it\u00a0<span>is cannot be compared to the real thing</span>.\u00a0 Quality matters with any ingredient,<span> but w</span>ith chicken more so than any other meat, commercial farming has sacrificed quality for yield and we are all the poorer for it<span>.</span><span>\u00a0 (Other contenders for the title of \"Common Food Most Ruined by Commercial Production\" are tomatoes, milk, sausages\u00a0and bread\u00a0 - but that's just my opinion.)</span><br><br>Wash and dry the bird and trim any visible fat, and the neck and feet (with many organic birds the neck is left on and the feet are trimmed at the ankle rather than at the drumstick joint.\u00a0<span>\u00a0</span>With the Nagoya Cochin the ankle is a\u00a0 deep black colour).\u00a0 Rub the skin\u00a0with the paprika and then add half the herbs, zest and garlic to the cavity, grinding in a generous amount of black pepper.\u00a0 In a Jamie Oliver recipe I saw for this once he added the entire lemon to the cavity.\u00a0 I have always found that this creates an overpoweringly wet and acidic lemon flavour from the juice that drowns out the delicacy of a good bird.\u00a0 In my opinion, it's best to stick to the zest only.<br><br>Roll out the dough to slightly\u00a0<span>thicker</span> than\u00a00.5cm and\u00a0<span>make sure it's </span>large enough to wrap the entire bird.\u00a0 Place the bird breast down\u00a0in the centre of the dough and then stack the rest of the herbs, zest and garlic on top<span> (i.e. the wing side that is facing up)</span>.\u00a0 Fold the dough around to totally enclose the bird and pinch together any holes.<br><br>Lightly oil your baking try and turn the package folds down<span>, </span>so that the breast is now facing up.\u00a0 Glaze the\u00a0<span>top of the </span>dough with the reserved egg yolks and put into a pre-heated 220C oven for 1.5 hours.\u00a0\u00a0<span>The glaze will give a nice even browning and shine to the dough for presentation.\u00a0 </span>Relax and tidy up your mess.<br><br>That is honestly how easy it is.\u00a0 When everything was done I threw the entire case into a bag (lined with a little newspaper just in case of any leaks) and headed off to my friend's house with some raw asparagus, a bottle of Veuve Cliquot and a six pack of Heineken<span> in a cooler bag</span>.\u00a0 We served the chicken with chargrilled asparagus (white, green and purple asparagus just salted and chargrilled with\u00a0<span>organic </span>lemon wedges<span> on the side</span>, some salads my friend had made and some beautiful sourdough another friend brought.\u00a0 We also had\u00a0a quiche,\u00a0and\u00a0sweets <span>from a local patisserie</span><span>\u00a0rounding out the meal</span>. <br><br>To serve the chicken, use a serrated bread knife to open a \"lid\" in the dough.\u00a0 Do this at the table to really appreciate the aroma that's released.\u00a0 Then just carve the chicken as usual and discard the dough (don't eat this, please).\u00a0 It was\u00a0<span>almost </span>an hour<span> and a half</span>\u00a0from\u00a0<span>the </span>oven to\u00a0<span>when we were </span>eating<span>,</span> but<span> insulated\u00a0by</span> the dough case the meat was still warm and tender.<br><br>A few bottles of nice red wine later (Montes NapaAngel) later and we\u00a0were all very\u00a0full and satisfied. \u00a0I need more afternoons like this.

She jumped at the offer and begged me to make strawberry shortcake, which is her favourite, so how could I say no, right? Strawberry shortcake is usually done with scone-like biscuits, cream and fresh strawberries, but since it was going to be a birthday cake, I wanted to jazz it up a little. I decided to go with a fairly simple, but light and fluffy butter cake, which I would layer with vanilla cr\u00e8me chantilly and strawberries macerated in some sort of liquor (I picked an orangey one). Anyway it turned out well, so I decided to put it up here. :)</span><br><ol><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">Divide the strawberries into 2 bowls - reserving the prettier ones in one bowl in the fridge. For the less-pretty bowl, halve the smaller ones and quarter the bigger ones, then mix them gently in a non-reactive bowl with the brown sugar and the cointreau. (You'll probably want to taste the mixture to adjust the sweetness and alcohol content.) Set aside for at least 2 hours, or overnight.</span></li><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">Preheat the oven to 175\u00b0C. Butter two 9x2 inch round cake pans, line the base of each pan with greaseproof paper, then butter the paper. Dust with flour, tapping out excess, and set aside.</span></li><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">Sift the flours, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl, whisk lightly to mix evenly, then set aside.</span></li><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (3 minutes). Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat for 1 more minute. Add the eggs, one at a time, ensuring that each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one. Add the vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed, add one quarter of the flour mixture, alternating with one third of the milk, until both are fully incorporated.</span></li><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">Divide the batter between the two prepared pans, and smooth down. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the cakes are golden brown and pass the toothpick test. (You will probably need to rotate the cakes halfway through for even browning.) Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let them cool for 20 minutes, then invert the cakes out, peel off the parchment, and let them cool right-side-up until completely cool.</span></li><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">Combine the whipping cream, icing sugar, and vanilla extract in a cooled bowl. (To whip cream, it's best to ensure that everything - including the metal implements - are cold. I place my mixing bowl and whisk/whisk-attachment in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before using them.) Whisk to stiff peaks, then store in the fridge, covered, until ready to use (or for up to 1 hour). Drain the macerated strawberries, reserving the soaking liquid in a squeeze bottle.</span></li><li><span style=\"font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana;font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;\">Using a serrated knife, trim the tops off the cakes to level them. Place one layer on your serving plate, and squirt some of the strawberry-cointreau mix over the cake (I used about\u00a0\u00bc of the liquid as I wanted the cake to remain fluffy), then spread 1/3 of the cream over it, leaving a 1-inch border from the edges of the cake. Evenly distribute the drained strawberries over the cream. Place the other cake on top, then squirt with a little more of the strawberry liquid, top with the rest of the whipped cream, creating a slight dent in the centre of the cream, and top with the reserved whole strawberries and garnish with mint and a dusting of icing sugar if using. Serve immediately.</span></li></ol>                ", "title": "Strawberry Shortcake Recipe"}

Around the umeshu bottling season, ume and the other ingredients are readily available all around Japan. \u00a0Unfortunately, I think those of you in other countries might struggle a little to find what you need. If you can get ume, make sure to use the unripe\u00a0green fruit, not the yellow fruit which is more commonly used for umeboshi.<br><br>The basic method for umeshu is very simple. \u00a0You need the ingredients listed and a large glass container of around 5L in capacity. \u00a0Again, in Japan umeshu jars are readily available but if you can't find them a very large pickling jar would be fine.<br><br>The sugar should be rock sugar (or 'ice sugar' in Japan). It looks like solid white crystals the size of a coin. \u00a0Normal sugar will not do, although as you see in the variations you can add a number of different sweeteners together with the rock sugar.<br><br>The spirit used also varies greatly. \u00a0In Japan, people will use shochu or the commercial 'White Spirit' sold in liquor stores at around 35% alcohol by volume. \u00a0Brandy and vodka are also relatively popular. \u00a0I will definitely make this with rum one day (whether rum alone or blended with other spirits).<br></p><ol><li>Wash the ume and leave in a colander to air dry. \u00a0Do the same with your jar.</li><li>Using a skewer, remove the stems from the ume. \u00a0These should come out quite easily.</li><li>Layer the sugar and ume in the jar (there is no need to prick the ume, although some recipes do call for this) in alternating layers and then cover with the spirit until fully submerged.</li><li>Leave in a cool, dark place for at least 3 months, but it is better after 6 or more. \u00a0You can swirl the container every week or so for the first few months if you like, but this is also not important.</li></ol><p><br>It really is that simple.\u00a0 I usually drunk this over ice or mixed with soda water for a very sweet and refreshing apertif or digestive.<br><br>I made the Cumquat and Honey version in 2007 and I am enjoying it immensely now, and the Black Sugar version last season in 2008.\u00a0\u00a0The Black Sugar version took a little longer to mellow in flavour, but after about 12 months was aged nicely.\u00a0 </p><p>This year I was unfortuantely out of the country for much of ume season so there is no 2009 vintage resting under my bench, but thankfully this infusion method works for all kinds fruits.\u00a0 I am still on the lookout for what try for 2009.\u00a0 The current front runners are strawberry and pepper, or\u00a0lemon and red shiso, but I haven't quite decided yet.\u00a0 <br><br></p>                ", "title": "Umeshu Variations Recipe"}

I love small get- togethers like these, so you\ncan imagine how early I began searching through my endless delicious\nbookmarks. We knew I had to be cooking Asian cuisine, for no other\nreason then the fact that, well.. I am Asian. And so, not limiting\nmyself to a particular region, I began the search. We concluded with...<br><br>1. Pork and Chive Potstickers for the appetizer<br>2. Bo Luc Lac and Vietnamese Red Tomato Rice for the entree, and;<br>3.\nVarious types of alcoholic drinks for dessert (which of course, we\nsipped, or took large gulps of throughout the course of the dinner).<br><br>Now,\nto be frank, I have never had Bo Luc Lac in my life! So I searched the\nweb for recipes that had flavors that melded well together. I finally\nfound a recipe I liked for the beef on Viet World Kitchen, and I adapted it while making minor changes of my own!<br><br>As\nfor the onions however, I came up with my own little recipe (primarily\nbecause I was missing an essential ingredient, so I improvised). In the\nend, I can say I was happy with the results. <br><br>As for the rice,\nI have had the Red Tomato Rice before, because my boyfriend's mom\nusually makes it to serve with her delicious steaks. But I have never\nattempted to make it, but here I was, dabbling with the ingredients,\nand coming up with something quite delicious. I must say, I was\ndefinitely proud of myself. I don't have a picture of it here, but if\nyou can find it in my previous post. here.<br><br>I wish I had more\npictures from the preparation process, but it's difficult to take\npictures while your hands are soaked in marinade or smell like garlic.\nAnyway, here goes!<br><br><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cooking Directions:</span><ol><li>Mix all marinade ingredients together, along with beef, and let sit in the fridge for 2+ hours.</li><li>Mix\nall ingredients for the onions together in a shallow bowl, and place\nonions in. Ensure that all onions strains are immersed inside the\nsolution. Let sit for 15-20 minutes</li><li>After 2+ hours, heat a large frying pan with oil.</li><li>Sear\nthe beef in small batches. Doing this allows the beef to sear, if you\nthrow all the beef in at one time, you will cause it to steam instead.\nThe effect isn't the same. If you sear the beef, the middle will still\nretain its moisture, and the beef will be medium/medium rare. If you\nsteam it, it has the potential to get soggy and mushy like beef in stew.</li><li>Get the lettuce and onions together in a large plate, and place the seared beef on top.</li><li>Serve right away with the red tomato rice!</li></ol><br>I'll\npost the recipe for the Red Tomato Rice in the next entry, since this\none has grown quite long.
